COVER
Russia’s oil and gas industry is facing momentous challenges, with
the devaluation of the ruble, low oil and gas prices, difficulties in
obtaining credit for major projects, high taxes, and altercations
with transit countries.Transit disputes have led to disruption of gas
supplies to major European markets, some of which are seeking
gas supplies elsewhere.The articles on pp. 18, 26, and 27 address
these issues as Russia’s industry seeks solutions to its problems.The
cover illustrates production operations in giant Samotlor oil field in
West Siberia. Samotlor production peaked at 3.2 million b/d in
1980 and fell to 400,000 b/d in 1999 but has climbed back to
600,000 b/d under a redevelopment program by TNK-BP, which
became operator in 2003. Photo from TNK-BP.

Alberta offers incentives to boost drilling
Alberta oil and gas producers have been offered royalty incentives from a provincial government hoping to revive drilling.
The government has reduced royalty for conventional wells
spudded between Apr. 1 and Mar. 31, 2010, and for wells coming
onto production in that period.
The drilling incentive is a crown royalty credit of $200/m of
hole drilled. The credit can’t reduce an operator’s overall royalty
rate to below 5%.
Benefits will be greatest for the smallest producers, determined
by a sliding scale based on production.
New wells eligible for the production incentive will receive a
maximum royalty rate of 5% for 12 calendar months or until production reaches 50,000 bbl of crown production or 500 MMcf of
natural gas.
A single qualifying well can receive both the drilling and production incentives.
The incentives don’t apply to oil sands drilling or production.
“This program is focused on keeping drilling and service crews
at work while also recognizing the enormous economic benefits
this activity has in Alberta communities,” the provincial energy department said in a statement.
Tristone Capital Inc., noting that drilling in Alberta is expected
to decline 28% this year, greeted the incentives skeptically.
“We are long [on] supply in North America, and adding productive capacity today is not desirable,” it said. “And we believe
the margin of cash that is retained by the incentives will predominantly focus on debt reduction.”

eficiary, receiving about 92,000 b/d of Venezuelan oil, while the
other nations in the scheme each receive around 80,000 b/d.
Last December, Panama’s trade and industry ministry reported that studies on the proposed construction of a 350,000 b/d
refinery at the Port of Armuelles were almost finished. In 2007,
Panama agreed to cooperate with Qatar Petroleum and Occidental
Petroleum on the project. The two companies commissioned Foster
Wheeler to conduct the studies.

Oil market tough on lower-middle income areas
Lower-middle income countries were the most vulnerable to
global oil price increases over 10 years, according to a new study
released by the World Bank’s Oil, Gas & Mining Policy division.
The study, presented Mar. 3 during the bank’s week-long extractive industries conference, defined vulnerability as the ratio of the
value of net oil imports to gross domestic product. A country’s oil
price vulnerability rises if its oil consumption increases and its oil
production decreases per unit of GDP, it explained.
“For countries that consume more [oil] than they produce, a
change in the balance of—the value of net oil imports is a measure
of the adjustment that will have to be made when oil prices rise
(in the absence of other offsetting exogenous shocks). The adjustment will have to be made by deflating the economy to restore the
balance of payments or running down foreign exchange reserves,”
it said.
The study, “Vulnerability to Oil Price Increases,” included data
for 161 countries and covered the 1996-2006 period. It was written by Robert Bacon, a consultant to the World Bank division, and
Masami Kojima, a lead energy specialist in the group. A summary is available online at http://rru.worldbank.org/documents/
publicpolicyjournal/320-OilPrices.pdf.
_________________________
The report also found that factors related to oil’s consumption
and production other than its price also influenced a country’s oil
price vulnerability. Consumption-related factors are oil’s share in
total commercial energy use, the ratio of commercial energy consumed to GDP (or energy intensity), and the proxy-real exchange
rate. Production-related influences also included oil production
levels and the inverse of GDP, it said.
“This study demonstrates that policymakers can, to varying degrees, reduce the vulnerability of their countries’ economies to oil
prices by influencing import dependence and reducing the economy’s energy intensity, among other factors,” said Somat Varma, the
World Bank department’s director.

Venezuela, following a meeting between Panamanian President
Martin Torrijos and his Venezuelan counterpart Hugo Chavez, will
allow Panama to join Venezuela’s Petrocaribe fuel assistance program.
Venezuela “takes note” and accepts “with great satisfaction” Torrijos’ request, which “will contribute to strengthening the ties of
cooperation among the countries making up the initiative,” said
Venezuela’s foreign ministry after the two presidents met.
Launched by Chavez in 2005, Petrocaribe now includes 18
countries in and around the Carribbean Sea. Under the initiative,
member countries pay 60% of the cost of Venezuelan oil at the
time of purchase and can defer the remaining 40% as financing
for development projects, repayable over 25 years at a 1% interest rate.
During 2005-08, Petrocaribe distributed some 59 million bbl Mixed results to come from USFS move to DOI

GAO said according to many agency officials and experts, where
the mission of the USFS, which now is part of the US Department
of Agriculture, is aligned with those of DOI agencies (in particular,
its multiple use missions which is comparable to that of the US
Bureau of Land Management), a move could increase some of the
agencies’ programs and policies overall effectiveness.
“Conversely, most agency officials and experts GAO interview
believed that few short-term efficiencies would be realized from
such a move, although a number said opportunities would be created for potential long-term efficiencies,” GAO’s report continued.
“Many officials and experts suggested that if the objective of a
move is to improve land management and increase the effectiveness and efficiency of the agencies’ diverse programs, other options might achieve better results,” it added.
The proposal is periodically discussed because BLM and the
USFS often manage adjacent federal acreage. The agencies already
work together on some activities, including onshore oil and gas
lease sales in which BLM sometimes includes some USFS tracts at
that agency’s request.

Gas-consuming nations need to rethink their tax policies if they
are to encourage gas imports and remove barriers, said Chakib
Khelil, Algeria’s energy minister, at a forum in Algiers. He said that
existing tax policies only protected narrow interests and hindered
the expansion of the gas industry in Europe.
Algeria is the third-largest exporter of gas to Europe. Khelil
said that, as gas is cleaner than coal, it must be given a tax advantage.
State-owned Sonatrach is constructing two major gas pipelines
to Europe, each with a capacity of 8 billion cu m/year. Medgaz
and Galsi are expected to be completed by yearend and in 2012
respectively. Sonatrach also announced plans to boost capacity of
two existing pipelines linking it to Italy and Spain by 7.7 billion
cu m in 2009.
But whether Algeria can deliver these output increases is questionable, according to analysts, considering the few companies that
were awarded licenses in its latest licensing round, the location of
small discoveries, and the need to build new pipelines to bring
them to market (OGJ Online, Feb. 10, 2009). ✦

BP makes oil discovery with Leda off Angola
BP Exploration (Angola) has made its seventeenth discovery
with its Leda well, which was drilled on ultradeepwater Block 31.
On test, Leda flowed 5,040 b/d through a 36⁄64-in. choke.
The Leda well, which reached 5,907 m TD subsea, was drilled
through salt to access the oil-bearing sandstone reservoir.
Leda lies in the central northern portion of Block 31, 415 km
northwest of Luanda field and 12 km southwest of Marte field. It
was found in 2,070 m of water.
BP, as operator, holds a 26.67% interest in Leda. Partners are Esso
Exploration & Production Angola (Block 31) Ltd. 25%, Sonangol
P&P 20%, Statoil Angola AS 13.33%, Marathon International Petroleum Angola Block 31 Ltd. 10%, and TEPA (Block 31) Ltd. 5%.

InterOil’s Antelope-1 shows promise in PNG
InterOil Corp. reported that its Antelope-1 wildcat onshore Papua New Guinea could contain sufficient gas to supply the first LNG
train in its proposed Liquid Niugini Gas project near Port Moresby
after the well flowed a record 382 MMcfd of gas. The flow was accompanied by 5,000 b/d of condensate.
Antelope has reportedly intersected the largest onshore vertical hydrocarbon column—2,600 ft (gross)—in the Asia-Pacific
region. The company’s reservoir engineers estimate the discovery
could contain more than 10 tcf of gas. Independent estimates are
now being conducted.
Put with previous discoveries at the Elk field in the region InterOil says it is proceeding with plans for a two-train LNG plant
capable of producing up to 9 million tonnes/year of LNG beginning late 2013 or early 2014.
Liquid Niugini Gas was originally a joint venture of InterOil,
Merrill Lynch, and finance firm Clarion Finance. InterOil says it has
now acquired Merill Lynch’s stake in the project.
It previously selected Bechtel to carry out front-end engineering

and design as well as engineering, procurement, and contract work
for the LNG plant. In addition, the JV had also chosen ConocoPhillips’s optimized cascade process technology for the plant design.
The plant is to be built near InterOil’s Napa Napa refinery in
Port Moresby and will be capable of producing 5 million tonnes/
year of LNG from a single-processing train. Despite the success at
Antelope, the second train remains an option that has yet to be
confirmed.

Pemex makes oil, gas ﬁnds in Gulf of Mexico
Mexico’s state-owned Petroleos Mexicanos, which has budgeted
more than $12.2 billion for oil and gas exploration in 2009-12,
has discovered “significant” amounts of natural gas and condensate
with its Tsimin-1 wildcat well drilled in the Gulf of Mexico.
The Tsimin-1 well had initial production of 4,400 boe/d, Pemex said.
Meanwhile, the state firm also announced the onset of gas production of the Cali-1 well in its Burgos project, with production
starting at 9.1 MMcfd of gas.
Pemex, which drilled the discovery well in August 2008 on Mision block in Burgos, said the development of the field will provide
an additional 90-110 MMcfd of gas.
Pemex also listed four light oil discoveries in its fourth-quarter
2008 financial results, with the Xanab-DL1 offshore well being the
most productive at 9,200 b/d of oil.
The discoveries coincide with a statement by Pemex Chief Executive Officer Jesus Reyes Heroles stating that the firm likely discovered 30-35% more oil and gas in 2008 than in 2007.
“It was a very good year in general terms and very important
with respect to the previous year,” Reyes Heroles said. During
2007, 1.053 billion boe were incorporated, he said.
He said the firm, before making any more details public, is awaiting final certification of its reserves by independent consulting firms.

Corcel block in Colombia’s Llanos emerges
Production has built to more than 13,000 b/d from two wells
on the Corcel block east of Villavicencio in Colombia’s Llanos basin, said Petrominerales Ltd., Bogota.
With Corcel-D1 and D2 producing from Eocene Mirador, Corcel-D3 topped Mirador 8 ft high to prognosis and encountered
hydrocarbon shows. Corcel-E1 is to spud later in March.
The Corcel central processing facility is capable of handling
70,000 b/d of fluid, and an upgrade to 140,000 b/d is to be complete in the third quarter.

Drilling

&

An offloading station at Monterrey, 77 km from Corcel, that will
provide preferential rights to deliver as much as 20,000 b/d into
Colombia’s main export pipeline is 42% complete. Early start-up
of 11,000 b/d of delivery capacity is planned for May 2009. Full
capacity is due in the third quarter. The facility is to cut trucking
costs by as much as $6/bbl.
Petrominerales was awarded blocks 25 and 31 totaling 333,708
acres north of Corcel in late 2008. It will spud its first exploration
well on the Guatiquia block just southwest of Corcel in July targeting a 3D seismic prospect. ✦

Kipper drilling to begin in 12 months
Esso Australia, Melbourne, has contracted to begin development
drilling on its Kipper gas-condensate field in Bass Strait early in
2010.
The company has secured the use of the Ocean Patriot semisubmersible under an agreement with Diamond Offshore and Apache
Energy for some well slots in between its program for Apache in
the region next year.
The Kipper drilling project could take 3-6 months.
The field lies 45 km offshore in 100 m of water. It has a confirmed resource of 620 bcf of gas and 30 million bbl barrels of
condensate.
First gas production, which will be piped to shore via the West
Tuna platform, is targeted for the first half of 2011. Output is expected to be around 75 terajoules/day with an estimated field life
of 11 years.
Partners in the Kipper JV are Esso as operator with 32.5%, Santos 35%, and BHP Billiton with 32.5%.

Rwanda’s Lake Kivu gas project advances
ContourGlobal, New York, signed a contract with Rwanda’s
government to extract solution gas from Lake Kivu to generate
electricity.
The $325 million KivuWatt project is to start generating 25 Mw
in 2010 and another 75 Mw 2 years later. Power from a plant at
Kibuye, Rwanda, is expected to ultimately supply Uganda, Congo
(former Zaire), and Burundi as well as Rwanda.
ContourGlobal plans to develop, build, and operate several
barges to extract methane from lake water at 350 m. It will process
the gas and move it by pipeline to the Kibuye generator, which will
more than double the amount of power produced in Rwanda.
Rwanda’s Electrogaz power distributor will buy the electricity
under a 25-year contract.
ContourGlobal has been designing and developing the project
for 2 years and has run extensive seabed surveys and methane gas
sampling at the lake’s lower depths.
The lake is estimated to contain nearly 2 tcf of methane and five
times that much carbon dioxide subject to explosive release within
a few hundred years in connection with nearby volcanic activity.
About 1.3 tcf is believed recoverable. The volumes are believed to
be growing.
Lake Kivu, 485 m deep, covers 2,400 sq km. Its surface elevation is 1,462 m.

— Q u i c k Ta k e s

The project is designed to overcome a severe electricity shortage, cut deforestation, and reduce the risk of an uncontrolled release of the lake’s gas, the company said.
The government placed in operation a 4 Mw pilot plant in November 2008 that is feeding electricity to the national grid, ContourGlobal said.

IOSC JV to boost oil production in Iraq
Mesopotamia Petroleum Co. Ltd. (MPC) has signed an agreement with Iraqi state-owned Iraqi Drilling Co. (IDC) to form a
new joint venture focusing on increasing oil and gas production
in Iraq.
“This is the Iraqi ministry of oil’s first joint venture agreement
of its type signed with a foreign company since the fall of the regime of Saddam Hussein in 2003,” said MPC.
The company’s name will be Iraqi Oil Services Co. LLC (IOSC),
which will drill several wells for the nation’s oil companies and international operations. On a conservative basis, these are expected
to yield 5,000 b/d/well. About 60 wells/year are to be drilled
around Basra as soon as possible, according to IDC.
In 2008 Iraq produced 2 million b/d, which the ministry is eager to boost to 3 million b/d as soon as possible and to 4.4 million
b/d within the next 4 years. Iraq wants to achieve 6 million b/d of
production by 2013.
“The parties to the joint venture intend to invest a total of $400
million to enable [IOSC] to purchase and operate 12 new drilling
rigs and for provision of logistical support and working capital
in order to deliver state-of-the-art performance in its operations,”
MPC said. IOSC also wants to improve local Iraqi expertise and
integrated drilling technology.
IOSC is owned on a 51-49 basis by IDC and MPC respectively.
MPC was founded by Ramco Energy PLC and Midmar Energy Ltd.
Idriss Al-Yassiri, director general of IDC, said IOSC had great
potential inside and outside of Iraq.
Steve Remp, executive chairman of MPC, added that IOSC’s
longer-term ambition is to emerge as a partner with Western oil
consortia in future field development projects.
This initiative builds on a wave of deals Iraq has signed to encourage investment and boost oil production, such as the $3.55
billion reconstruction agreement with SK Corp. (OGJ Online, Feb.
24, 2009) and an upgrade of its oil export terminal (OGJ Online,
Feb. 20, 2009). ✦

Pertamina renews reﬁnery upgrade plan
Indonesia’s state-owned PT Pertamina, renewing interest in an earlier
plan, has signed a memorandum of understanding with Dubai-based
Star Petro Energy (ETA Group) and Japan’s Itochu Corp. to upgrade the
country’s 260,000 b/d refinery at Balikpapan in East Kalimantan.
“By signing the memorandum of commitment, Pertamina and
those companies will hold further talks on upgrading Balikpapan
refinery,” company spokesman Anang Noor said of the signing,
which took place at the World Islamic Economic Forum in Jakarta.
Karen Agustiawan, Pertamina president director, expressed hope
that negotiations with ETA Group and Itochu would be concluded
soon so that the project could be started on time.
State Enterprise Minister Sofyan Djalil, who said that negotiations with the two firms are continuing, estimated the venture as
worth up to $1.7 billion. “It is still a tentative figure,” he said, adding, “We still have to explore the actual price.”
Pertamina has previously said it wanted to boost capacity at the
Balikpapan refinery, which has two crude distillation units with
respective capacities of 200,000 b/d and 60,000 b/d.
Pertamina said it wanted to increase total capacity to 280,000
b/d, switch from sweet crude to cheaper sour crude, and add a
50,000 b/d cracking unit to process heavy residue into gasoline

— Q u i c k Ta k e s
and petrochemical products.
In October 2008, Pertamina set up a joint venture with Itochu
and ETA Star to revamp the Balikpapan refinery. Pertamina processing director Rukmi Hadihartini said, “Each company’s stake is yet
to be decided” and that a project feasibility study was “expected to
be ready in January 2009.”
In January, however, Pertamina cancelled plans for expansions at
two of its largest refineries—Cilacap in Central Java and the Balikpapan facility—due to the economic crisis and low oil prices.
At the time, Pertamina President and Director Ari Soemarno said
the expansion plans could continue once the market stabilized,
adding that the contractors—Japan’s Mitsui and Toyo engineering
corporations and South Korea’s SK Corp.—were unwilling to provide quotes for services because of the volatile oil market.
Neither Pertamina nor the two other firms explained what
brought about the change in policy since the decision in January
not to proceed with the upgrade.
Last month, Pertamina, aiming to reduce fuel imports by boosting domestic supply, announced plans to construct two new refineries: one at Bojonegara, Banten, and another at Tuban, East Java. It
also announced plans to upgrade a third facility at Balongen, West
Java (OGJ Online, Feb. 15, 2009). ✦

Shell’s Escravos pipeline suffers explosions
Shell Petroleum Development Co. (SPDC) reported that its transEscravos oil pipeline in Nigeria’s Delta state has been breached in
three places.
A company spokesperson told OGJ that it had shut-in oil installations in the Niger Delta to minimize potential damage to the
environment. No details were given on how much had been lost
at the pipeline.
“It was first reported on [Feb. 28] and confirmed during an assessment on the ground; the authorities have been notified,” she said.
There have been explosions on the 24-in. line, which transports oil
from the fields in the western Niger Delta to the Escravos export terminal.
SPDC is carrying out an investigation with the authorities and
local communities to confirm the cause and the extent of the damage. “The incident was first reported by surveillance personnel on
[Feb. 28],” she added.
The company declined to say how long the investigation would
take or when the pipeline would be restored.

Vietnam proceeds with expansion of tanker ﬂeet
Vietnam’s Dung Quat Ship Building Co., based in the central
province of Quang Ngai, has held a keel-laying ceremony for a
long-planned 105,000-tonne Aframax oil tanker.
The 244-m tanker, which is scheduled to be completed during
third-quarter 2010, is one of three new ships that will be placed
in the service of Vietnam’s newly built 140,000-b/d Dung Quat
refinery.
In June the Dung Quat refinery also is scheduled to receive
a second Aframax oil tanker, slightly smaller at 104,000 tonnes,
10

— Q u i c k Ta k e s

from Dung Quat Shipping Industry Co.
The two ships appear to be part of a larger 3-ship plan worked
out by the Vietnamese government last year to ensure adequate
shipping for the new refinery, as well as others under construction
or in the planning stage.
Last December Petrovietnam’s shipping arm PV Trans said it
planned to invest as much as $3 billion altogether over the next
7 years to upgrade its crude and oil product tanker fleet to meet
demand from Vietnam’s refineries.
At the moment, the Dung Quat facility is the country’s only
refinery, but Vietnam has set a target to have at least three major
refineries by 2013 as part of efforts to reduce product imports.
The Ho Chi Minh City-based company also said it aims to expand its businesses to operating floating storage and offloading
vessels for Vietnam’s oil producers.
A week before making that announcement, PV Trans secured
a $175 million loan from a group of foreign banks led by Citigroup to purchase three 80,000-120,000-tonne Aframax tankers
to transport oil for the Dung Quat plant.
In addition to Citigroup, lenders include Calyon Corporate
& Investment Bank, Fortis Bank, and Societe Generale, while the
13-year loan was guaranteed by Nippon Export Investment Insurance and Petrovietnam.
In February 2008, ahead of the $175 million loan facility, the Dung
Quat Ship Building Co. said it had imported nearly all the steel and other
building materials needed to build the three Aframax oil tankers.
At the time, Dung Quat Ship Building Co. General Director Cao
Thanh Dong, said each of the three oil tankers would likely cost
more than $60 million. ✦

Oppose cap-and-trade
That oil and gas companies differ over political issues is nothing new and usually constructive. Sometimes, however, unanimity can be helpful. A looming
decision on climate change presents such an occasion.
The question here is not whether response is in
order. Political realities make that question moot. A
response will happen, probably soon. It probably
will cap emissions of greenhouse gases and allow
trading of emission allowances. Some oil and gas
companies, aligning themselves with President
Barack Obama and congressional leaders, favor
that structure. Others prefer a direct tax on carbon
emissions.
Companies in the latter camp are right. Others

on political deceit. Like any other imposed reduction in emissions of greenhouse gases, cap-andtrade will raise the costs of using fossil energy. To
have any effect, it must punish consumers enough
to make them cut their use of fossil energy. Trading
of emission allowances can’t dissipate the pain. A
new study by Bryan Buckley and Sergey Mityakov
of Clemson University examines seven assessments of the cap-and-trade legislation most like
Obama’s proposal and concludes mitigation costs
will be “huge.” Those inescapable costs, imposed
by government, will have the effect—but not the
appearance—of a tax.
Yet politicians make full use of the illusion that
cap-and-trade means someone other than consumers bears the costs. Obama wrapped himself in

The Russian-Ukrainian “gas war”
that took place for 20 days in January
and the disruption in December 2005
are part of a long-running struggle between Ukraine and Russia over pricing
and transit fees.1
The latest confrontation is the most
recent in a long line of disputes, not
only with Ukraine but also with Belarus, a smaller but important transit
point for Russian gas moving
to European markets. These
pricing and delivery commitment disagreements have
been an ongoing feature of
Russian relations with both
countries since the fall of the
Soviet Union.
The most recent dispute has heightened European concerns over dependence on gas supplies from Russia. The
European Union’s foreign policy chief,
Javier Solana, said Europe has paid a
heavy price because of the disruption in
gas supplies and would review its energy relations with Russia and Ukraine as

a result. He added that efforts to further
diversify energy sources would move to
the top of the EU’s agenda.
Ironically, Europe’s initial interest in
gaining access to Russian gas supplies
in the 1970s was the result of concerns
over excessive reliance on oil imports
from Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries.2
18

Diversification away from Russian
gas has been a major theme of European energy security policy over the last
20 years, although it has not necessarily
been faithfully implemented. Europe
gets about half of its gas imports from
Russia, but dependence varies widely
throughout the EU.
The view that “excessive” dependence on Russian gas would place
Europe in a vulnerable position has also
been a central theme in US foreign policy, which has encouraged Europeans to
seek alternatives to Russian gas through
greater production from the North Sea,
imports of LNG, use of alternative fuels,
and direct pipeline links to gas reserves
in Central Asia.
Considering the realities of pricing
and transportation costs in the European gas market, it is clear that buyers and
transit partners, as well as Gazprom,
bring leverage to the markets. Russia
and the transit partners, for example,
would suffer large and long-term losses
if European customers diversified away
from Russian gas. Russia’s more accessible and near-term gas production is
closer to Europe than any major alternative market. Russia and Europe are
bound by geography, and moving gas to
Asian markets or exporting it globally
as LNG would impose higher costs on
Gazprom and lower wellhead values.
At a recent presentation in London,
Gazprom admitted that the Nord Stream
and South Stream pipelines were meant
to augment export supply flexibility
rather than to increase volumes, which
would put additional financial pressures
on the already stretched state budget.3
From the perspective of transportation
economics, Ukraine and Belarus are the
low-cost routes for moving Russian gas
to the European continent, a fact well
understood by both transit countries
(see map, OGJ Feb. 19, 2007, p. 18).

Running toward Gazprom?
In light of these circumstances, and
given the constrained financial environment in a low-cost oil and gas market,
a more effective strategy for Europe
would be to run toward Gazprom

Low oil price impact
The collapse in oil prices in fall
2008 and declining economic activity throughout Europe will show up
in lower gas prices and lower sales
throughout 2009 along with lower
revenues (Fig. 3). In 2008 Gazprom’s
gas exports to Western Europe averaged
a record $409/1,000 cu m (Mcm),
according to the company. With the
collapse of oil prices beginning in July
2008, Gazprom will be charging lower
prices to Europe in 2009—estimated by
the company to be $280/Mcm, some
32% less than the 2008 average (Fig.
4). According to a recent presentation
to investors, Gazprom said its exports
to Europe may decline 5% in 2009 to
170 billion cu m (bcm) from 179 bcm
in 2008 and the average price will drop
as stated.5 These figures would reduce
European export revenues by about $26
billion, or 35%.
Note that Gazprom’s price estimate
aligns with EPRINC’s estimate in Fig.
1 based on Brent crude. Although the
Russian government is raising the
regulated price of domestic gas by 20%,
which will increase revenues by roughly $2.5 billion, it is hardly enough to
make up for the $26 billion decline in
European export revenues.
Exports to the Former Soviet Union
(FSU) states will also command higher
prices than in 2008. Russia historically

has sold gas to the FSU at discounted
prices but has begun to move the FSU
to European market pricing. However,
the increase is not large enough to
cushion the fall in revenues from Europe and may be compounded by lower
volume sales in 2009.
Across all three consumer groups,
expect revenues to drop by about $22
billion compared with 2008. This number will change very little unless oil
moves from $40/bbl between March
and June.

fields in western Siberia, mostly commissioned during the Soviet era, are in
decline, putting promises of future production at risk. These concerns are forcing Gazprom to develop riskier plays
such as Shtokman in the Barents Sea.
Gazprom also has plans for further
development of Yamal in Northern
Siberia and two elaborate pipeline projects, Nord Stream and South Stream,
both of which circumvent Ukraine.
Officials have remained confident that
the company’s main projects, namely
Shtokman, Yamal, and Nord Stream,
will continue as planned. There is concern, however, as to whether Gazprom
can simultaneously carry out these
ambitious projects as revenues and
demand decline and large amounts of
debt come due this year.
Shtokman is a gas field containing
an estimated 3.8 trillion cu m (tcm)
of gas. It is expected to begin producing gas in 2013 at the earliest, though
development has yet to begin and
Gazprom’s minority partners in the
project, Total and StatoilHydro, have
yet to finalize investment plans. Initial
development is expected to cost $12-20
billion and could grow more expensive
over time. It is planned as a feeder field
for Nord Stream, which if completed in
2011 will take gas from Russia directly
to Germany under the Baltic Sea.

ment Co. said in December 2008 that
nearly 70% of Shtokman will have to be
financed and that a minimum price of
$50-60/bbl for oil is required to make
the project feasible.9 This implies a

producing gas in 2011. Its largest field,
Bovanenkovo, is estimated to contain
4.7 tcm of gas, and the company says
production will eventually reach 140
bcm/year. A 1,100 km westbound
pipeline begun in 2008 will connect
Bovanenkovo to Gazprom’s Ukhta hub,
which will allow for exports to Europe
via the existing Yamal-Europe pipeline
through Belarus.10 In all, the peninsula
contains at least 16 tcm of gas, according to Gazprom’s estimates.
The development of the fields in the

Yamal peninsula may cost upwards of
$100 billion, with Bovanenkovo alone
costing $60 billion. Between Yamal,
Stokhman, Nord Stream, and South
Stream, Gazprom is planning projects
with a combined cost of around $120
billion, most of which it is likely responsible for, with planned completion
dates of either 2011 or 2013, depending on the project. Ground has not
been broken on Shtokman and South
Stream, and the projects have a level of
technical difficulty Gazprom has not
had to tackle in its Soviet era fields.
Gazprom has laid out extremely ambitious development plans. It appears as
if the company has erred on the side of
optimism, as timely completion of any
one project will be very difficult given
current economic factors and the lack
of progress made on projects thus far.

Debt, devalued ruble
If massive revenue declines and exorbitant project costs are not enough
to make the Kremlin anxious about
Gazprom’s well-being, there is the issue of its debt. The company currently
carries about $42 billion in debt and is
obligated to make payments of about
$10 billion in 2009.11 12 The company

everyone agrees, conventional wisdom
is that by 2020 Europe is likely to
see its gas consumption rise by 25%,
with increasing supplies coming from
abroad, as domestic production likely
will fall by more than 40%.17 Fig. 6
shows Russia’s primary nondomestic
gas customers.
Western Europe has limited gas
reserves, mainly in the North Sea, and
some argue that production is reaching
or has reached its peak.18 According to
the European Committee on Economic
Affairs and Development, “Germany,
France, the Netherlands, Spain, and
Italy are among the world’s 10 largest
importers of crude oil, while the same
countries and Turkey are also among the
10 largest gas importers.”19
Despite Gazprom’s worsening
financial situation and complex relations with downstream partners such
as Ukraine, Russia has a commitment
to meet 25% of Europe’s gas needs.
Russia exports roughly 465 million
cu m/day to Europe, and 80% of that
flows through Ukraine. Wealthy Western
European nations generally exhibit less
dependency on Russian gas than poorer,
Eastern European nations (Fig. 7). That
trend is reflected in Fig. 5, which shows

less energy from all other types of fuel.
Much of the FSU still receives Russian gas at a subsidized rate, although
Gazprom is moving prices to market
rates, partly because it purchases 60
bcm/year of gas from Central Asia. That
gas, which is then exported to Europe,
is no longer accessible at prices well
below market values. Central Asian producers have moved, or can threaten to
move, their production to more lucrative markets (China, Nabucco).
In 2008 exports to Europe generated
$73 billion in revenue for Gazprom,
compared with domestic sales revenue
of $37 billion and exports to the FSU of
$14 billion. Even though Europe represents only about 30% of Gazprom’s
sales volume, it accounts for 60% of
its revenues. In 2008 Russian customers paid about one eighth of the rate
per thousand cubic meters as European
importers paid.
As the European market is Gazprom’s
largest revenue source, it is perhaps
as dependent on Europe in terms of
market access and revenue as Europe is
dependent on Gazprom. As EU Energy
Commissioner Andris Piebalgs said:
Gazprom exports most of its energy
to Europe because Europe is a familiar
market and the market economy where
Russians know they “will get very good
profits for their gas.”20 Gazprom saw
record export revenues in 2008 for

its gas as European gas prices topped
$500/Mcm towards the end of 2008.
However, with the rapid collapse of oil
prices in the fall of 2008, the prices
declined as well.
Recently, Alexander Medvedev,
deputy chairman of Gazprom’s management committee, announced that gas
exports to Europe would be reduced
if the economic decline persists and
energy demand falls further.21 Gazprom
said it would wait until the end of the
first quarter of 2009 before deciding on
a cutback in exports if demand falls sufficiently in Europe.22 The effects of the
fall in production could be felt more
sharply in the longer run, potentially
leading the company to seek financial
assistance from its foreign partners to
develop new fields.

The pipeline dilemma
Gazprom’s potential obstacles in financing major projects do not end with
development of upstream resources.
The 55 bcm/year capacity Nord Stream
pipeline, intended to connect Russia directly to Western Europe without transiting any Eastern European countries,
would serve dual purposes. It would
avoid Ukraine and would add capacity
to the existing system if European demand increased and new supplies came
online. It is already facing rising costs
and delays, however. The Nord Stream
consortium has elevated the cost of the
originally 4-5-billion-euro pipeline to 8
billion euros ($11.64 billion).
Complex negotiations with Baltic
littoral states to get permits to build the
undersea pipeline have further stalled
the project. Similarly, the fate of the
South Stream gas pipeline, which is
planned to link Russia with Austria and
Italy via a pipeline through the Black
Sea, is beset with more delays and cost
overruns. The project may cost over $31
billion, as opposed to the $20 billion
announced in July 2008 by Russia’s
Energy Minister Sergei Shmatko. It also
would carry a maximum of 47 bcm/
year—8 bcm/year less than the planned
Nord Stream. See Tables 1 and 2 for
a breakdown of costs, capacities, and

completion dates.
Construction of the onshore portion
of Nord Stream has begun, though not
the tricky undersea portion, meaning
Nord Stream has some momentum
behind it, although perhaps not enough
to see it through to completion, while
South Stream has not left the planning
phase, leading many to believe it is little
more than a fantasy.
The latest Russia-Ukraine gas crisis
has clearly encouraged Gazprom to
move forward quickly with Nord
Stream construction. While Nord
Stream solves some problems by bypassing all existing transit states with
the contentious pipeline disputes common in central and Eastern Europe, it
also opens concerns that the project will
bolster Russia’s leverage in the region.
Once Nord Stream is up and running, least cost strategies for dispatching gas to the European continent may
lead to the abandonment of transport
volumes along established transit routes
in favor of shipping gas through Nord
Stream.23
Reliance on Nord Stream may create
so-called network risks, i.e., it offers
Gazprom the opportunity to deliver
supplies to its western European customers while remaining in a position
to curtail supplies to some of the gasdependent Eastern European countries,
particularly Poland. While this is a
genuine concern, Russia has so far been
reluctant to cut off customers paying
market prices.

Risks
Although Nord Stream appears to
be moving forward, it does face some
completion risks, both from cost overruns and from opposition from littoral
states. Vladimir Milov from the Russian
Institute of Energy Policy argues that
the pipeline will cost at least $13 billion and is an ecologically dangerous
construction that may not be financially
justified.24
Russians have taken a large part
of the financial risk and have already
begun construction on their end and
are putting various supply and service

contracts in place. Even based on the
higher construction cost estimates,
Nord Stream should be able to operate within a cost structure competitive
with existing transit costs for moving
supplies through Belarus and Poland.
Additionally, Europe is expected to
see substantial growth in longer-term
gas demand, and Nord Stream should
handle the new volumes.
One big “if” with regards to Nord
Stream is Shtokman field. Gazprom apparently is building Nord Stream with
the intention of feeding it with Shtokman gas. As discussed earlier, ground
has not yet been broken on Shtokman,
and it is set to begin production 2 years
after Nord Stream is scheduled to be
completed in 2011, creating doubt
about the viability of a 2013 start.
Whether or not Gazprom can afford
development of Shtokman at the moment will further impact the viability
of Nord Stream. If Gazprom can bring
the two projects together in a relatively
timely and economic manner, it could
become a powerful asset for Gazprom.
Even before gas prices collapsed and
the financial crises hit, Nord Stream
was far from being a certainty; now it
is even less so. Whether or not Nord
Stream fulfills its objectives and becomes a cost-effective project, resolving
the transit risks in Ukraine and Belarus
will still generate substantial benefits to
the producer, shippers, and consumers.

Russia-Ukraine gas confrontation raises major questions
Nick Snow
Washington Editor
The confrontation between Russia
and Ukraine in January over natural gas
raises questions not just for Europe, but
also for the US, experts indicated at a
recent seminar at the Heritage Foundation.
“Russia’s energy influence extends
all over the world, including the US.
The importance of its gas is that its
European customers are tied to the
pipeline and can’t replace supplies from
elsewhere,” said Marshall I. Goldman,
emeritus professor of Russian Economics at Wellesley College and a senior
scholar at the Davis Center for Russian Studies at Harvard University.
Edward C. Chow, a senior fellow
in the energy and national security
program at the Center for Strategic
and International Studies, said the
Russia-Ukraine gas confrontation
was not surprising. The 10-year
agreement that the two countries
signed Jan. 19 will be lucky to survive 10 months, he predicted.
Jonathan Elkind, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution’s
Foreign Policy Program and Energy
Security Initiative, agreed. “It’s a dynamic situation and it’s not over yet.
A key requirement of the Jan. 19 sales
agreement is that Ukraine stay current
on its payments. If it doesn’t, then it
starts paying on a month-ahead basis,”
he said.
Laslo Deak, political counselor from
the European Commission’s delegation
to the US, said that Europe is trying to
take a dispassionate view toward Russia,
which is having a difficult time defining
its relationship to Europe. He said Vladimir V. Putin, first as Russia’s president
and then as its prime minister, wanted
to do this in terms of energy dependence. “The Soviet oil and gas structure
simply provided an opportunity,” Deak
said.
26

A lesson for the US
David W. Kreutzer, a senior policy
analyst in energy economics at the
Heritage Foundation, said an important lesson for the US is not to grow
too dependent on imported natural gas
as it pursues climate change reforms.
Wider use of wind to generate electricity could make US gas imports grow to
back up wind, which is intermittent,
he said. “We need to be more careful. We’re putting forth policies [that]
ostensibly would make us more energy
independent but could actually have the
opposite effect,” he warned.
Karen A. Harbert, president of the
Institute for 21st Century Energy at
SPECIAL

The New Russian Regime

Foundation and the seminar’s moderator, said European dependence on
Russian gas is of strategic interest to
the US. One reason is that it influences
individual countries’ policy decisions
such as Germany’s leading the opposition to expanding the North Atlantic
Treaty Organization, he said.
Several in the group also said
Ukraine needs to improve its internal
energy operations. Cohen noted that the
country uses as much gas as Germany,
but its gross domestic product is only
10% the size of Germany’s. Chow said
Ukraine has become a major hydrocarbon transit country, through which
most of Russia’s oil and gas exports to
Europe pass. “There has been no
fundamental reform of its energy
sector since the Orange Revolution 4 years ago, and the problem
isn’t going to fix itself,” he said.

Ukraine’s internal
challenges
Elkind suggested that with
a presidential election on the
horizon, Ukraine’s domestic
politics could produce calls for
energy price subsidies to stimulate economic growth as it tries to keep
the US Chamber of Commerce and a
import costs in check. He expressed
former assistant US energy secretary
hope the US would have a successively

During the next 8-9 years, Lukoil
plans to produce 300,000 b/d of oil
from the North Caspian Sea area, and he
said the Y-K project in the Barents Sea
has over half a billion bbl of reserves to

He also said the major portion of the

are based in rubles, which contributes
to its cash flow by reducing capital

Lukoil also operates in nearly 40 other
countries.

The advantages of Russia’s lower
production costs, however, are offset by
the taxes, duties, and tariffs, which the
government sets, recalculating export
duties every 2 months, said Boris Zilbermints, vice-president of exploration
and production for Gazprom Neft, the
oil subsidiary of OAO Gazprom.
However, “Minister Kudrin’s scissors” [delayed revisions of high oil
export duties following sharp reductions in oil prices]“caught up with the

when export taxes exceeded oil prices
and revenues,” he said.
The government’s legislative changes
as of Jan. 1, which reduced corporate
income taxes and other taxes, “are
substantial but still insufficient,” Zil-

bermints agreed. “A lower tax burden
would be totally offset by growing oil
production,” he stressed.

Congressional energy leaders’
responses to the budget’s oil and gas
tax provisions generally followed party
lines.
US House Natural Resources Committee Chairman Nick J. Rahall (D-W.

president’s proposal places a major
emphasis on ensuring that taxpayers
receive a fair return for the extraction
of oil and gas resources on public lands
and presses wealthy oil companies to
diligently develop the leases they already possess on the Outer Continental
Shelf,” he said.

friendly way possible for the sake of
our nation’s economy, our nation’s
security, and the world’s environment,”
Murkowski said.
Sen. Mary L. Landrieu (D-La.), who
is on the Energy and Natural Resources Committee, called the budget
proposal “an honest and balanced
blueprint for America’s future” that
“emphasizes high-return investments
and makes significant strides in restoring fiscal responsibility and deficit
reduction.”
But she expressed concern about
changes it would make in the oil and
gas tax regime. “In these tough times,
we must make sure that we do not disadvantage our domestic energy industry,
which is critical to the nation’s security,
against foreign competitors. This industry provides good-paying jobs and plays
a critical role in helping us reduce our
dependence on foreign oil,” Landrieu
said.
After expressing his concerns about
carbon cap-and-trade provisions of the
president’s proposed budget, Sen. James
N. Inhofe (R-Okla.), the Environment
and Public Works Committee’s ranking
minority member, said the budget’s
proposed oil and gas tax increases
would potentially eliminate tens of
thousands of domestic jobs in the
industry, increase fuel costs for consumers, and make the nation even more
dependent on foreign oil.
“In the United States, there are nearly
6 million Americans directly and indirectly employed as a result of the oil and
gas industry. Tax increases of this magnitude will significantly curtail the operating budgets of all exploration and production companies, big and small. Every
marginal well operator in the country
should be gravely concerned that these
proposals will force the premature plugging of low-production marginal wells.
And, despite the rhetoric, America’s oil
companies are already paying taxes at the
highest rates,” he said.

Nonindustry responses
Nonindustry groups also responded
to the proposals.
Thomas J. Pyle, president of the Institute for Energy Research, said they were
not economic development but “a surefire way to send America’s businesses
either to bankruptcy or overseas.”
He said, “It’s alarming enough that
the administration’s plan to balance its
books relies on funds it hopes to receive
from a policy it hopes to someday enact. But what’s truly appalling is that it’s
attempting to sneak this huge stealth tax
into the budget at a time when so many
Americans are facing unprecedented
economic constraints.”
David Holt, president of the Houston-based Consumers Energy Alliance,

said that while Obama’s proposed
budget takes unprecedented steps to
develop new alternative energy sources,
it also takes unprecedented steps to
make producing affordable energy
from traditional sources more difficult
and expensive. “The realization of an
alternative energy future will not be
achieved by making a reliable energy
present impossible. My fear is that a
number of the provisions in this budget
would do precisely that at precisely the
wrong time for struggling consumers
and a flagging economy,” he said.
Environmental organizations expressed the opposite view. “Today’s
budget announcement makes clear

that the oil and gas industry will not
continue to enjoy a taxpayer-funded
feast at the expense of America’s public
lands and waters,” Wilderness Society
Pres. Bill Meadows said. “Following his
strong statement on climate when he
addressed Congress on Tuesday night,
the president today offered further
confirmation that it’s not business-asusual in Washington when it comes to
fighting global warming pollution.”
Erich Pica, domestic programs director for Friends of the Earth, said, “The
days of Big Oil earning record profits
while feeding at the taxpayer trough are
coming to an end. President Obama’s
decision to put an end to these giveaways is a huge victory for taxpayers
and the planet.” ✦

future for all of America.”
Ritter said he was working with the
state’s congressional delegation and
with US President Barack H. Obama’s
administration to ensure that the federal
recovery package includes funds for
electricity transmission lines. Within
Colorado, Ritter continued, legislators
have proposed bills that would require
that all new single-family homes come
with a “solar-ready” option, would help
finance business and residential clean
energy projects, and would develop
a plan for wind and solar projects for
rural schools.

A role for gas
“My thanks also to Colorado’s traditional energy sector, which is a key part
of our New Energy Economy,” Ritter
said. “We have some of the richest
natural gas reserves in the nation. We
must ensure Colorado’s gas continues to
meet America’s energy needs today and
serves as a clean-burning bridge fuel for
tomorrow. That’s why I’m working with
industry and others to include funds
for gas pipelines in the federal recovery
package,” he said.
Ritter also said he would ask the
legislature to finalize regulations, which
the state’s oil and gas commission
passed in 2008, to improve oil and gas
production practices. The Colorado Oil
and Gas Association and other groups
have said that the regulations are too
restrictive and could halt production
growth. The governor defended them.
“I’m proud of the commission’s work.
They listened to every interested party
and found the right balance. With these
rules, Colorado companies and Colorado workers can successfully drill for
gas, while our air, land, water, wildlife,
and communities are protected,” he
declared.

he US oil and gas industry found
plenty to dislike when President

But it’s possible that the subset that

Many stripper wells take 3 months to
fill a stock tank before the oil can be
sold to a refinery, she added.
Refiners set the price, Snyder said,
and after several years of mergers and
acquisitions, there are only two who
buy Illinois basin stripper oil. “These
refineries discount our sales price for
our 40° sweet crude at $8.25/bbl below West Texas Intermediate pricing
for sweet crude,” she said.

More sour crude

Most US refineries have retooled
their operations to process imported
sour crude, which also increasingly
flows into the US Strategic Petroleum
Reserve, Snyder said. Sweet crude
costs less to process, “but refineries
need volume every day and use sour
crude because sweet crude production levels have dropped since 1986,”

Rounds said that, while South Dakotans are working hard to generate more
energy from renewable sources, “huge
supplies of renewable fuels for South
Dakota and nationwide use will not
happen overnight, nor will they be able
to totally replace petroleum. Therefore,
for our own security, stable prices, and

TransCanada Pipelines Ltd. has proposed a pipeline system from Alberta
through the Dakotas to Oklahoma and
Illinois which would transport 590,000
b/d of crude oil from tar sands to US
refineries, he noted.
Rounds said he began issuing executive orders to let fuel delivery drivers

added.
“The company is committed to this

Alaska’s gas pipeline
Economic priorities should be a
powerful incentive for Alaskans to
think clearly and act decisively, not
politically, in pursuing funding for the
state’s next major economic lifeline:
the gas pipeline from the North Slope
to markets in the Lower 48 states, according to Palin. Alaskans were told
30 years ago that it would be impossible to build the Trans Alaska Pipeline
System, she pointed out.
The massive new project involves
challenges too, she continued, “but
we can be confident in this enterprise
because it’s founded on the fundamental interests of our state and nation.
America needs energy [that is] affordable, abundant and secure. With international conflicts, war, and environmental
concerns, laws and markets seek safe,
clean energy, and that’s what we offer.
The last president supported a gas line,

priorities, and financial reserves will be
depleted within a decade, she warned.
“Working together, we’re developing a
10-year plan to keep a healthy balance
in the Constitutional Budget Reserve.
We’re laying up stores, until strong revenue comes in with the flow of natural
gas to feed hungry markets here and
outside,” she said.
“In Alaska, all roads lead...to the
North Slope and to the central importance of our North American gas line.
America’s security, Alaska’s revenue,
Alaskan careers, affordable fuel, even
our ability to finally diversify our economy—all these hinge on the success of
this great undertaking. I assure you: The
line will be built. Gas will flow. Alaska
will succeed,” Palin declared.
Ironically, while the state has the
largest US oil and gas supplies and is
working to build a pipeline to deliver
4.5 bcfd of gas to markets farther south,
Alaska’s governor said that its citizens
are more vulnerable than other Americans to fluctuating energy prices.
“The solution for our state is much
the same as for the rest of our nation,
only the source is ours and much closer
to us, so delivery can come sooner,” she
said. “We’re facilitating a smaller, in-state
gas line with legislation we’ll hand you
next month. My goal for this in-state line
is completion in 5 years. It will carry
460 MMcfd of gas to energize Alaska.”
“Previously, we’ve relied on a
diminishing gas supply from Cook
Inlet, expensive diesel fuel, a mix of
government subsidies, and not enough
conservation, but that is not sustainable,” Palin said. “And it shouldn’t take
another spike in energy costs to stir us
into action. Alaska will help achieve
energy independence and security for
our country, and we can lead with a
long-needed energy plan for America.
“But let us begin with energy security for ourselves,” she added. “This
includes meeting my goal of generating
50% of our electric power with renewable sources. That’s an unprecedented
policy across the US, but we’re the state
that can do it with our abundant renewables, and with Alaskan ingenuity.” ✦

Venezuela
facing hard truth

I

f there’s anything like an essential
characteristic needed for the oil
and gas industry, it’s a sense of humor. In fact, when things get beyond
anyone’s control, the ability to laugh
may be the best remedy.
That’s how things are shaping up
when it comes to Venezuela these
days.
In fact, Venezuelan President Hugo
Chavez has vowed that his brand
of 21st century socialism would
triumph—even if the price of oil
plummeted to zero. But now, even El
Presidente is facing a hard truth.
“Oil prices are very low,” he
acknowledged in a speech at a recent
military parade in Caracas. “For
Venezuela, this is tough and difficult.
But even so, I will stick to what I have
said: We are not going to cut spending on the missions…food, health,
education and housing.”
How will that happen? Enter Venezuela’s oil minister Rafael Ramirez,
who also serves as head of the stateowned Petroleos de Venezuela SA,
to announce that the firm will cut
spending to help the country.

Ramirez the cost-cutter
Saying there had been “excessive
spending” in recent years, when oil
prices were high, Ramirez said, “We
[PDVSA] have to adjust to a situation
that does not allow for waste, spending that is not a priority.”
“It’s clear that we can’t have the
same level of spending as last year,”
said Ramirez, whose spending cuts
come down to renegotiating deals
with 250 contractors that were
reached last year as prices climbed to
record high levels.

Such cuts will enable PDVSA
to drop production costs by 40%,
Ramirez said.
Meanwhile, debt payments to
some 91% of the company’s 5,726
contractors began on Mar. 2. But
don’t get your hopes up. According
to Ramirez, not everyone will be
treated alike as “there is a segment
with which we must sit down to
discuss” new terms.
“I must defend the interests of
the nation,” he said, arguing that he
could not pay, for example, for drilling services at last year’s going rate.

The Emperor’s new cushion
Despite the need to tighten spending, Ramirez claims PDVSA has a
financial “cushion” and can still
maintain its planned investments of
$125 billion for 2009-13.
The cushion of resources is so
solid that “we can withstand and
keep ourselves going in any situation.” And echoing the president he
serves so assiduously, Ramirez said,
“We can work (even with) zero oil
income.”
Despite that cushion, though,
Ramirez has been touting investment
in Venezuela, saying that production
costs in the Orinoco heavy crude belt
are $1.50/bbl, making investment attractive despite the collapse in world
oil prices.
“It’s a huge opportunity right
now, especially when they are canceling projects in Canada’s heavy tar
sands because of the higher costs,”
the minister said. “We’re currently
offering six blocks in the Orinoco,
and we will remain open to foreign
investment,” Ramirez said.
Are you laughing yet? ✦

Effective Sept. 16, 2004, a law went
into effect that gives the Division of
Mineral Resources Management sole
authority in Ohio to regulate the permitting, locating, drilling, and operating of oil and gas wells and production
facilities.
The law was adopted with the understanding that the regulation of oil
and gas activities is a matter of general
statewide interest that
requires uniform
statewide regulation.
Previously, different
standards were in
effect throughout the
state.
The law created a
designation of urban areas and defined
them as all municipalities and unincorporated civil townships with a population greater than 5,000. Urban areas are
subject to greater rules and conditions
than nonurban areas.
Allowing drilling in urban areas has
affected both drilling and production.
Since the law went into effect, about

23% of all wells drilled have been in
areas defined as urban. In 2008, 318
of the 1,428 drilling permits issued
were in urban areas (Table 1). The rise
in proportion of drilling in urban areas
has contributed to a turnaround in an
otherwise downward trend in production in Ohio.

Permitting and drilling
The number of permits issued in
2008 was 8% more than in 2007.
The majority of these permits
targeted the Clinton sandstone (72%),
followed by the Devonian shale (12%)
and then permits below the CambroOrdovician Knox unconformity (11%).
Sixteen permits were issued to the
Marcellus shale formation. Permits were
issued in an average of 13 days of being
filed.
For the second consecutive year
and only the third time since 1991,
more than 1,000 wells were drilled.
An estimated 1,049 oil and gas wells
were drilled in 2008, a decrease of 16
wells or 1.5% from 2007. This is the
first decrease since 2002 (Fig. 1). Wells

Exploratory drilling continues to decline as a percentage of the total number of wells drilled (Fig. 2). Seventyfive wells (7%) of all wells completed
were classified as exploratory, which is
comparable to 2007. Of these, 51 were
productive and 24 were dry, representing a 68% success rate.
Exploratory wells were drilled in 28
counties. Gallia and Guernsey counties
each had nine exploratory wells.
Wells drilled to the Devonian shale
(25) and below the Knox unconformity (26) accounted for the majority
of exploratory activity. Drilling to the
Devonian shale continues to expand
geographically each year as new areas
are explored. All of these wells were reported as productive. A hurdle in some
of these areas is the lack of pipeline
access.
Wells drilled to formations below the
Knox unconformity, such as the Beekmantown dolomite, Rose Run sandstone, and Trempealeau dolomite are
almost always seismic prospects. Half of
these wells were dry holes.

optimizer to model the well sensitivity to changes in header pressure. The
optimizer computed optimal well
lift-gas set points to maximize gross
production, taking into account header
interaction, backpressure effects of gas
production, and lift-gas injection rate
constraints.
To verify the benefits of the optimizer, the operators conducted a sensitivity analysis on the lift-gas rate. Fig. 3
illustrates a case in which the analyst
simultaneously changed the lift-gas
injection rates to suboptimal settings,
resulting in production decline in spite
of an increase in lift-gas injection. This
validated the value of the optimizer.
The optimizer modeling and quantification of gas-lift header pressure effects indicated the need for an additional flowline to minimize backpressure
effects. When installed, the additional
header helped reduce backpressure
that led to a corresponding production
increase.
The optimizer application decreased
production decline. Fig. 4 shows the
5-year trend of platform production
before and after optimization. The trend
confirms that the use of the optimizer
has led to more stable operations and
has reduced production decline.
Shell also has deployed the optimizer
in onshore fields. One such production
facility is in a heavily populated urban
area with one gas well, five free flowing
oil wells and nine gas-lifted wells. The
oil goes to a nearby refinery and gas
enters a local gas grid.
The location does not allow venting, flaring, and surface water disposal;
hence, these limitations constrain
production. Other constraints that limit
total gas production are export and liftgas compressors availability and the gas
offtake rate.
The field also has to produce a
minimum amount of injected water
for reservoir pressure maintenance. The
constraint on water production, however, is from a combination of water
injection and water disposal capacity.
Gas sales detract from lift-gas required for oil and water production.
46

O D U C T I O N

Due to the direct supply of gas to the
gas grid, the gas offtake can change on
minimal notice.
Shell constructed optimizer models
for all of the wells and incorporated the
overall production constraints such as
export gas limits, compression capacity,
and water handling capacity (Fig. 5).
Because the field exported both oil
and gas, Shell configured the optimizer
to optimize on incremental revenue
from oil and gas sales.
Since introduction of the optimizer
on the production station, the daily
production stabilized. Fig. 6 shows the
optimal set points derived.
A third case illustrates another application in an offshore oil production
facility.
This offshore platform produces
6,000 cu m/day of oil and 450,000 cu
m/day of gas from 33 platform wells
and two subsea tiebacks. The platform
for power uses about 60% of the gas
production. All wells are on gas-lift and
have water cuts ranging between 10
and 95% with an overall 78 cu m/cu m
GOR.
Lift-gas optimization on the platform
was a process that had evolved over
time. The process involved a large number of users and data flows. Users only
were aware of their part of the process
and different shifts used different optimization processes.
The new optimizer provides a more
consistent and transparent process.
Onshore-based petroleum engineers
determine the models and rules for the
optimization and a production server
solely holds all data relevant to optimization for consistent use by all users.
The users obtain all optimization data
from the process historian and the distributed control system (DCS) receives
all optimal gas lift set points via the
historian (Fig. 2).
A key business driver for implementing the optimizer was the rate at which
the operator can restart a platform
after a trip shutdown. Since the implementation of optimizer in November
2006, the platform has experience
several trips. The optimizer has enabled

platform start-up on average 25% faster
than before with a corresponding increase in production. ✦

and nitrogen levels across a field. Other
concerns are the increased requirements of urban gas processing. In addition, the rapid production growth in
emerging shale areas can be difficult to
handle.
This article reviews which gas processing technologies are appropriate
for the variety of US shale gas qualities being produced and planned to
be produced and reviews regional gas
processing capacities to handle current
and future production of shale gas.

Gas processing removes one or more
components from produced gas to
prepare it for use. Common components removed to meet pipeline, safety,
environmental, and quality specifications include H2S, CO2, N2, heavy
hydrocarbons, and water. The technique
employed to process the gas varies with
the components to be removed as well
as with the properties of the gas stream
(e.g., temperature, pressure, composition, flow rate).
Acid-gas removal is commonly by
absorption of the H2S and CO2 into
aqueous amine solutions. This technique works well for high-pressure gas
streams and those

Haynesville play. This gas requires treating for CO2 removal. Operators in this
field are using amine treating to remove
the CO2 with a scavenger treatment on
the tail gas to remove the H2S. Most of
the treating is currently performed with
traditional amine units with 60-100
gpm capacities. These units are rented
or purchased. Most of the processed gas
enters the Carthage system, which then
distributes it across the country.
One of the biggest problems faced
by gas processors in the Haynesville
area is the large production addition
from each well as it is brought on line.
Plants that are oversized today become
undersized tomorrow. Area operators
suggest designing units that scale up
and down easily during the growth
process. This includes units that employ
valve trays, variable speed pumps, and
multiple trains.
Chesapeake announced that the
initial production rate for the last seven
horizontal Haynesville wells averaged
16 MMscfd each. If the pipeline announcements are any clue, industry is
anticipating a scramble for processing
plants for Haynesville much like the
rapid growth of the Barnett.
DCP Midstream Partners and M2
Midstream LLS have recently announced
a joint venture for a 1.5-bcfd pipeline
to be completed in early 2010. Energy Transfer Partners and Chesapeake

announced plans for the 42-in. Tiger
pipeline to connect from Carthage, Tex.,
to near Delhi, La., to be completed by
mid-2011. ✦

Recent experience and
forecasts have shown a
narrowing gap between
domestic natural gas
supply and consumption, unfavorable oil-toLNG
gas price disconnects,
increasing competition
for limited liquefaction capacity, and
dampened domestic demand due to the
current
economic
decline.
As a
result,
it seems
likely that
LNG’s
role in meeting the US supply shortfall
will be a supportive one in a highly
competitive international gas market.
Given these market conditions, a
merchant-based regasification strategy
that depends on the availability of spot
LNG cargoes is unlikely to be successful.
Liquefaction capacity owners will retain
a portion of the opportunity to capture
geographic price differentials instead of
selling it entirely to LNG marketers.
Such a role—and the associated costs
of building expensive LNG deliv-

ery systems for other than base-load
purposes—is unlikely to attract the
levels of sustainable investment required
for development of an extensive US
LNG market.
Since 1959, when the Methane
Pioneer demonstrated the feasibility
of transporting LNG in a transoceanic
trade, there have been two major waves
of enthusiasm for projects to bring LNG
from international sources into the US
natural gas market.

First wave
The first occurred in the 1970s, a
period of rising natural gas prices and
nearly universal forecasts of even higher
energy costs. Beginning in November
1971 with the first deliveries of LNG
from Algeria’s Sonatrach to Distrigas at
Everett, Mass., projects were developed
over 1971-82 to deliver large volumes
of LNG to terminals at Elba Island, Ga.,
Lake Charles, La., and Cove Point, Md.
These large, capital-intensive ventures involved the integrated construction of liquefaction and gasification
facilities as well as fleets of expensive
cryogenic tankers. Fig. 1 shows these
projects delivered relatively modest volumes to the US market for several years,
reaching peak delivery in 1979 of 253
bcf, which was 1.3% of US natural gas
consumption that year.
As these projects were getting under
way, however, federal regulatory initiatives began to change the fundamentals of the US natural gas industry. The
Natural Gas Policy Act of 1979 was the
first in a series of regulations that led to
a broad restructuring of the US natural
gas industry.1
These structural reforms precluded
a utility’s ability to pass on the costs of
more expensive contracted-for supplies
when lower-cost supplies were available on the spot market and could be
transported under the newly minted expedient of “open access.” With financial
support for projects of that era typically
long-term, take-or-pay arrangements,
this evolution changed the US LNG
industry.
Exacerbating the situation were

Second wave
By the early 2000s, higher gas
prices, declining domestic production,
and expectations of slowing Canadian
imports once again rekindled interest
in bringing LNG to US markets. Figs.
2 and 3, respectively, present a spike
in Henry Hub natural gas prices and deteriorating production profiles of major
US production areas (with the exception of the Rockies).2
Accordingly, in 2003 the US Energy
Information Administration forecast
that by 2015, LNG would become the
largest source of gas imported into the
US, rising to 39% in 2010 from 5% of
imports in 2002.3
That optimism reflected use of the
four existing US terminals, three of
which had been mothballed since the
1980s, as well as a flood of proposed
regasification projects. By June 2004,
there were 27 new regasification terminals in various stages of investor and
governmental approval for a combined
capacity of 31 bcfd,4 far more than
expected demand.5

contractual disputes over price with
Algeria’s Sonatrach, the sole producer
and supplier of LNG for these projects,
and national security concerns about
heavily relying on foreign suppliers of
energy for US consumption. Although
LNG’s peak year of supply saw imported
natural gas from countries other than
Canada or Mexico account for only
1.3% of US consumption, lengthy
gasoline lines as the result the 1973
embargo and dislocations caused by the
1979 Iranian Revolution remained in
the minds of American consumers and
energy planners.
Owners at the Cove Point and Elba
Island LNG terminals mothballed them
in 1980, and the terminal at Lake
Charles shut down shortly after its
completion in 1982. By 1987, there
were no deliveries of LNG to the US
and only minimal deliveries throughout
the 1990s.

imports to the US with deliveries of
771 bcf, accounting for 16.7% of natural gas imports but still only a modest
3.3% of US natural gas consumption.6
In 2008, stronger demand for LNG in
Europe and Asia diverted supplies from
the US. Imports for the first 10 months
of 2008 were only 298 bcf, about half

of recent forecasts.
It may be argued that this downturn
is cyclical in the development of a longterm LNG market and will be short.
Several temporary and fundamental
factors, however, emerged in 2008 to
cause this bearish year for US LNG.

ously linked—each experienced direct
independent shocks that depressed US
LNG imports in 2008. The future of
US LNG rests with how persistent and
powerful these dampening forces are in
the face of significant new liquefaction
capacity coming online and rising US
natural gas demand.
58

Global gas pricing
The US competes with other importers, especially southern Europe and
Japan,7 for LNG cargoes. Natural gas in
these two markets is generally linked to
oil prices, unlike in the US where natural gas prices are correlated to oil but
through substitution and production

effects vs. formula pricing. US natural
gas prices are linked to prices at Henry
Hub, the delivery point on the Louisiana Gulf Coast for natural gas futures
contracts on the New York Mercantile
Exchange. Henry Hub prices, although
rising until recently, have generally been
lower than prices linked to imported
crude oil, as they are in Asia, or to other
competing fuels, as they are in Europe.
With the run-up in crude price—
NYMEX prompt month crude futures
hit an intraday high of $147.27/bbl

disconnected in 2008 (Fig. 6).
The historic relationship between a
barrel of crude oil and an MMbtu of gas
is 8.1.9 In 2008, however, it averaged
11.5. This disconnect, combined with
the nature of international oil-based
formula pricing, meant that natural gas
prices were much higher in Europe and
Japan than in the US.
The pricing environment was
further stressed by a demand shock in
Japan, the world’s largest LNG importer. In January 2008, a combination of
cold weather and an extended nucleargeneration outage increased Japan’s
need for replacement gas generation,
driving LNG spot cargoes close to
$20/MMbtu.10 These pricing dynamics
explain why Cheniere Energy’s terminal at Sabine Pass, Tex., which has the
largest US regasification capacity, did
not receive a commercial delivery in
2008.
The collapse of crude prices in the
last months of 2008 brought the oilto-gas relationship back within normal
ranges that, if sustained, will favor a
more competitive domestic LNG market
in 2009 (Fig. 7).

Supply
US LNG imports were further dampened in 2008 by two key elements:
1. The near-term shortage of global
liquefaction capacity.
2. The rapid increase in domestic
production largely related to unconventional gas production as an alternative
to imported LNG.

Regasification capacity, which is
less expensive and time consuming to
construct than liquefaction capacity, has
substantially outstripped the availability
of new supply.10
Global liquefaction capacity has
been slow to come online, with only
a 1.9% increase during first-half 2008
compared to the same period in 2007.
This slow growth is due both to delayed
completion of in progress projects and
cancellation of new projects.
There were significant project
completion delays in 2008, including Tangguh, Sakhalin 2, Yemen LNG,
Qatargas 2 Train 2, and RasGas 3 Train
1.11 Stretched vendor manufacturing capacity has led to longer delivery times.
Governmental and lender requirements
have become more onerous, extending
the time for permitting and financing
closure. And detailed engineering with
less experienced personnel has also
extended project timelines. Industry reports are that Qatar actually shut down
some of its gas-to-liquids projects due
to overextension of limited worldwide
manufacturing and engineering capacity.
As for new projects, there are a few
reasons for the slower entry of new
LNG liquefaction projects. The first is
the increased cost of capacity, from
previous levels of about $200/metric
ton to more than $600/metric ton in
many cases. This reflects engineering,
manufacturing, and construction costs
that are higher than before. Secondly, oil
companies have been cautious in making investments based on gas prices that
might not be sustainable.
Finally, some projects that were
being developed have stalled or been
delayed due to government intervention; examples include Russia-Sakhalin
(delayed), Iran-South Pars (canceled),
Algeria-Arzew and Skikda (delayed),
and Bolivia-Pacific (canceled).
In combination with previously
mentioned pricing issues, this regasification-to-liquefaction capacity imbalance has left the US as the global swing
market for excess LNG supply. This

From the Subscribers Only area of

Obama’s budget
isn’t just change;
it’s derangement
Change is nearly always good. The same
can’t be said for derangement. President
Barack Obama, who ran for ofﬁce as the
high priest of change, has crossed this line.
He must believe the wildest energy
delusion of his party’s leftmost fringe: that
the US can subsidize its way off oil and gas
and run the economy on alternative energy
forms.
It can’t do so anytime soon. But it can go

broke trying.
The budget Obama sent Congress on
Feb. 26 would demolish capital formation
by the US oil and gas industry.
It proposes to raise $31.5 billion over 11
years by eliminating “oil and gas company
preferences” in taxation (OGJ Online, Feb.
26, 2009).
It would levy an excise tax on Gulf of
Mexico production.
It would repeal the expensing of intangible drilling costs by producers and the
manufacturing tax deduction for oil and gas
companies.
It would increase the geological and
geophysical amortization period for independent producers to 7 years and repeal
percentage depletion for oil and gas.
It also would repeal the enhanced oil
recovery credit, marginal well tax credit, deduction for tertiary injectants, and passive
exception for working interests in oil and
gas properties.
For an additional $17.2 billion, the budget would revive the “Superfund” tax to
pay for cleanup of abandoned hazardouswaste sites.
Many of these and other proposals,
such as use-it-or-lose-it lease stipulations
and increased fees for operating permits,
resurrect bad ideas considered but rejected
by Congress.
Revenue projections associated with
them are illusory, obviously assuming
levels of oil and gas activity that would be
impossible if the changes were enacted.
This nest of economic snakes isn’t the
usual, sophomoric slap at “Big Oil.” The
imperiled drilling preferences are crucial
to small operators. Percentage depletion,
in fact, is available only to independent
producers and restricted for all but the
smallest of them. This is a broadside attack
on US oil and gas in general. It makes
Obama’s talk about cutting dependency on
foreign oil and reviving the economy laughable but sobering.
The president and the country he leads
need a quick dose of reality.

Crude market tries to stabilize
The price of gasoline climbed and crude hit a 1-month high in a 3-day rally before
dropping slightly Feb. 27 on the New York futures market.
The April contract for US light, sweet crudes climbed to $45.22/bbl Feb. 26 on the
New York Mercantile Exchange after the Energy Information Administration reported
an unexpected large drop in US gasoline inventories, down 3.4 million bbl to 215.3
million bbl in the week ended Feb. 20. The same contract slipped to $44.76/bbl in the
next session, the last for that short month, as the Department of Commerce reported
the US gross domestic product fell 6.2% during the last quarter of 2008. That was the
largest decline in GDP since the ﬁrst quarter of 1982. Economists were expecting a
decline of 3.8%.
“Yes, unemployment is high, but the lower gasoline prices seem to ﬁnally have
an impact, and with jet [fuel] demand down 15.4% (237,000 b/d), it does seem that
Americans are back to driving rather than ﬂying,” said Olivier Jakob at Petromatrix,
Zug, Switzerland. He said 2008 was the year of distillate vs. gasoline, while 2009
seems to be gasoline vs. distillate. “In that regard,” Jakob said, “we need to keep in
mind that reﬁneries are currently on maintenance and that it is not unusual to have
all sort of glitches when the units are brought on line.”
In New Orleans, Pritchard Capital Partners LLC analysts said, “If gasoline price response continues, gasoline demand may push utilization up and continue to support
crude prices and even pull some crude out of storage and reduce contango spreads
seen across curve.” EIA data indicated US gasoline consumption in the 4 weeks
through Feb. 20 was up 1.7% from year-ago levels.
Paul Horsnell at Barclays Capital Inc., London, noted US demand for gasoline has
been relatively robust in the face of the economic cycle compared with diesel and jet
fuel demand, which have been far more negatively affected. “Gasoline inventories
are much lower year-over-year and demand is improving, while distillate inventories
are much higher year-over-year and demand is not improving,” he said.
However, Larry Goldstein, a director at Energy Policy Research Foundation
(EPRINC), said EIA is comparing the latest 4 weeks of preliminary data with ﬁnal
revised data from a year ago and getting the wrong ﬁgures. “The correct comparison
is [preliminary] weekly against [preliminary] weekly,” Goldstein told OGJ. “That will
show a measurable improvement in the decline rate but still a modest decline from
negative 3.5% several months ago to about 0.5% decline over the last 4 weeks—a
major improvement but still modestly negative,” he said.
OPEC is ‘adamant’
Members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries “remain adamant
about compliance of supply cuts and will likely cut production quotas further next
month,” said analysts in the Houston ofﬁce of Raymond James & Associates Inc.
However, they said, “The biggest driver remains the economic uncertainty and its
effect on demand.”
Raymond James reduced their oil price forecasts to $43/bbl from $60/bbl for
2009 and to $65/bbl from $80.bbl in 2010 “due to the severity of the global economic
meltdown and bloated inventory levels at Cushing, [Okla.],” key delivery point for
US crude. They said, “Non-OPEC supply has peaked, while demand will eventually
recover. If such a recovery occurs in 2010, our forecast will move much higher.”
Adam Sieminski, chief energy economist, Deutsche Bank, Washington, DC, said,
“Additional OPEC cuts and more convincing signs of an economic upturn are required to stabilize oil prices. Since we expect the G7 [industrialized nations: Canada,
France, Germany, Italy, Japan, UK, and US] will require additional ﬁscal stimulus
packages to support growth, we remain skeptical of near-term crude oil price rallies.”
But at KBC Market Services, a division of KBC Process Technology Ltd. in Surrey, UK, analysts said, “There is a sense that the [oil] market might be starting to
tighten.”
At Barclays Capital, Horsnell noted the recent sharp reduction of US crude
imports. “The data also show the ﬁrst week of imports below 5 million b/d into the
Gulf Coast since the height of the hurricane disruption. The ﬁgures may well show
occasional blips as the remaining ﬂoating storage dissipates and partially enters the
data, and trends in time structure and tanker rates suggest that that process is likely
to gain pace,” he said. However, Horsnell said, “Despite the scope for temporary
boosts to imports while the amount of ﬂoating storage is reduced, we would still
expect to see a fairly prolonged period of year-over-year crude oil import compression to set in.”

A secret beginning
The ﬁrst application of coiled tubing (CT) technology was not for oil wells, but for a plan to lay
emergency pipelines across the English Channel during World War II. Allied engineers made
coiled tubing from 40-foot lengths of 3-inch pipe
and spooled it around huge ﬂoating drums that
could be towed behind ships. In 1944, some of
the 23 secret pipelines they laid delivered Allied
fuel for the Normandy invasion.
The Allies made their coiled tubing by welding joints of pipe end to end. The idea is simple
enough, but making coiled tubing that is safe and
dependable is much more complicated. The lowgrade steel used in the early days couldn’t take
the tensile stress of heavy loads, and the many
welds required to produce continuous spools of
pipe frequently leaked or broke.
Steady improvements in manufacturing and
metallurgy through the 1970s and 80s greatly
improved the reliability of coiled tubing. In 1990,

the ﬁrst string of 2-inch coiled tubing was milled
for a permanent well completion, and suppliers
soon began offering coiled tubing up to 4-½
inches outside diameter.
Service companies quickly developed new CT
applications. In well workovers, coiled tubing became the tool of choice for removing cement plugs
and scale. When customers said they wanted to
drill more slimhole wells for exploration and production, coiled tubing was a natural choice.

The big advantage of coiled tubing, of course,
is that tripping in and out of a well is continuous.
That is not only faster than making up joints of
tubing, it requires fewer people on the rig ﬂoor
and makes the whole operation safer.
Coiled tubing units can also deploy downhole
tools that cannot be run on conventional wirelines. The two main beneﬁts, however, are that
with coiled tubing, operators can pump ﬂuids
through the coil, and they can push tools into
the well rather than lowering them down on a
wireline. Depending on the size of the spool and
diameter of the pipe (1 inch to 4.5 inches), coiled
tubing is available in lengths in excess of 30,000
feet. Once reserved for niche services only, coiled
tubing is now an essential well intervention tool.
For drilling and workovers, CT rigs are much
smaller and lighter than the rigs that use conventional tubing, and they need less room at the drill

2

site. Some oil and gas operators now use CT
routinely to drill shallow wells. In unconsolidated
sands, coiled tubing rigs can drill at rates up to
1,300 fph, compared 400 fph for conventional
rigs. Current technology allows CT drilling beyond 7,000 feet, and some heavy-duty units are
targeting depths of 10,000 feet.
Coiled tubing moved offshore in the mid1980s, where CT engineers had to overcome
much greater challenges than they faced on
land. Even though CT is lighter than rigid-tubing
rigs, the equipment was still too bulky for most
offshore platforms, and if the tubing was deployed from a nearby vessel, operators had
to deal with the vertical and lateral movement
caused by the sea. Today, thanks to CT SEAS*
Safer, Efﬁcient, Automated Solutions other advanced Schlumberger technology, coiled tubing
offshore is an increasingly valuable option.

The basic CT rig

The main components, other than the spool of
coiled tubing itself, are the injector head, the
stripper and the blowout preventers. Of these,
the injector head is the driver, because it is the
machine that pushes and pulls coiled tubing in
and out of the well. The device includes a curved
gooseneck beam that guides the coiled tubing
from its spool into the top of the injector head.

Pipe passing through the injector head
straightens before it enters the wellbore.
A stripper, set below the injector head,
contains the packing that seals the outside diameter of the tubing and isolates
pressure from the well.
Blowout preventers, located below
the stripper, are emergency devices that
can either cut the coiled tubing and seal
the wellbore, or if necessary, seal the
casing or riser.
The tool string at the bottom of the coil
is called the bottomhole assembly. One
advantage of coiled tubing is that it can
run a much wider range of tools and perform many more downhole jobs than can
be done with conventional wirelines.

Applications

Coiled tubing can perform almost any downhole
job. In depleted gas wells, CT has even been
installed as production tubing and can be run
inside a well’s conventional tubing string. While
many production engineers think of CT as an
alternative to wireline service—and it is—the
technology is much broader than that.
Well cleanouts: Nearly half of all coiled tubing
jobs are done to get a well back in production
by circulating ﬂuids and debris from the wellbore.
Through an innovative mix of hardware, software,
ﬂuid cleanout systems and monitoring, production engineers worldwide are using Schlumberger
coiled tubing applications to reduce the cost and
risk of cleanout operations and quickly return
their wells to production.
The difﬁculty of any cleanout job depends
largely on the geometry of the well, properties of
the cleanout ﬂuid, ﬂow rate, downhole pressures,
the nature of the solids that must be removed,
and how deep they are in the well.
Cleanouts are relatively easy for shallow wells
with simple geometries. When deviation angles
reach above 40 degrees, however, almost any
wellbore can be hard to clean. Often, several techniques are combined to clean one well.
Schlumberger began integrating its wellbore
cleanout and optimization systems in 2002 and
continues to improve this robust lineup.
Jet Blaster* jetting scale removal service is a
CT-conveyed through-tubing tool that uses a
rotating head and high pressure ﬂuids to remove

4

scale, including hard scale (strontium and iron
sulﬁde), from wellbores in one trip. It is a fast
and cost-effective alternative to nozzle systems,
positive-displacement motors, impact hammers
and other techniques on the market.
PowerCLEAN* engineered ﬁll removal service
is a CT service that efﬁciently lifts sand, silt,
wax, scale and other debris from the wellbore.
The system’s innovative software, coupled with
engineered nozzle and ﬂuids, optimizes the job
by evaluating the ﬂow rate, circulating pressure,
bottomhole pressure and other variables before
taking each bite of ﬁll.
Workovers: In recent years, coiled tubing has
become an efﬁcient, cost-effective solution for
open-hole milling, fracturing and many other
workover jobs.
CoilTOOLS* is a one-stop source for the latest
downhole CT tools. The portfolio includes standard
bottom-hole assemblies such as motor heads,
connectors, check-valve, disconnect assemblies,
knuckle joints, ﬁxed and hydraulic centralizers,
ﬁxed and rotary wash tools, nipple locators, gauge
carriers and the entire suite of downhole valves.
Discovery MLT* multilateral tool is a costeffective reentry system for maximizing the
performance of multilateral wells. The downhole
tool sends a pressure signal to conﬁrm that it has
reached the correct lateral. The tool’s orientation
adjusts from the surface and provides real-time
feedback, which greatly increases the chance of
a successful reentry on the ﬁrst try to Level 1 and

2 multilateral wells. The Discovery MLT software
displays several essential parameters, such as the
tool’s orientation relative to the lateral window. The
application also monitors previous indexes and
guides the operator through subsequent indexing
cycles to provide accurate, real-time information.
Coiled tubing is often used to pump ﬂuids to
speciﬁc sections of a well, and Schlumberger has
a suite of CT tools that make the job go easier.
CoilFLATE* through-tubing inﬂatable packer designed for extreme conditions. CoilFLATE packer
can isolate selected perforation intervals with
pump-through capability, without the need for a
workover rig. The system also allows operators to
permanently abandon zones or temporarily isolate areas of the wellbore for testing.
CoilFRAC* stimulation through coiled
tubing is a well stimulation service that
incorporates unique bottomhole assemblies to selectively isolate zones
of interest. CoilFRAC service can treat
multiple zones in a single trip and stimulate zones that were bypassed during
the original completion. Many operators are using this economical system
to stimulate lower-producing zones that
were too expensive to treat before.
CoilCAT* coiled tubing computer-aided treatment raises informed real-time
decision making to a new level of conﬁdence.
The new CoilCAT well site service makes well
interventions more efﬁcient and reliable. CoilCAT
service combines the Coiled Tubing Sensor Interface advanced data acquisition system with the
Universal Tubing Integrity Monitor and software to
efﬁciently merge design, execution and real-time
evaluation capabilities in one package.
Perforating: Coiled tubing offers many advantages over other conveyance systems, particularly
for highly deviated and horizontal wells. First is

the strength and rigidity of the tubing, which can
endure more tensile and compressive forces
than wireline systems. Schlumberger routinely
runs coiled tubing perforating strings in excess of
2,000 feet (600 meters) on Alaska’s North Slope.

For live wells, CT perforating can run long
gun strings and either drop them off or retrieve
them without having to kill the well. The ability
to continuously circulate through the tubing also
makes it easy to spot-treat with ﬂuids. Treating a
carbonate interval with acid just before perforating, for example, creates cleaner perforations.
In depleted wells where there is not enough
difference between the bottomhole pressure and
pressure from the reservoir, nitrogen can be circulated to lighten the ﬂuid column and increase
the drawdown at the target zone.

Fit-for-purpose
solutions

CT EXPRESS* rapid-deployment coiled tubing
service is designed for low- to medium-pressure,
intermediate-depth land-based wells. The simple, reliable design can handle rough terrain and
extreme weather conditions.
The unit consists of just two trucks and a crew
of three. One truck holds the CT rig itself, and the
second vehicle carries a combination nitrogen
and liquid pump, plus electrical and hydraulic
systems to run the entire unit. Since there are no
hydraulic or electrical connections to be made
on location, rig-ups are safer and more efﬁcient
than with other systems. During ﬁeld tests, CT
EXPRESS crews performed more than 200 jobs
without a lost-time incident.
With CT EXPRESS service, rig-up and rig-down
times are as short as 30 minutes. Coiled tubing
rigs with similar capabilities typically require four
trucks and a crew of ﬁve. CT EXPRESS service
can be used on wellheads up to 20 feet high; the
system can also be deployed onto the rig ﬂoor of
land rigs if required.
CT SEAS* Safer, Efﬁcient, Automated Solutions, is a ﬁt-for-purpose offshore CT system
that greatly improves the efﬁciency and safety
of moving from one well to the next. Designed
for harsh offshore conditions, the system incorporates the same proven process control and

6

distributed architecture of the CT EXPRESS
rapid-deployment coiled tubing unit for landbased operations.
Speed is a key feature. In some cases, well-towell time is as little as four hours. The system’s
ergonomic design, smaller footprint and high degree of automation also make it less costly than
other alternatives.
The CT SEAS system provides one central
control point for the entire coiled tubing operation, as well as real-time data acquisition and data
transfer to offsite locations. The versatile, spacesaving design combines all the major coiled
tubing components into modules that are easy
to transport and assemble with zero discharge.
Because several key processes have been automated, CT SEAS systems also require fewer
operators than conventional CT units, which is a
real advantage offshore.
CT SEAS systems have a ﬂexibility that makes
them readily adaptable for many offshore structures, including platforms, ﬂoaters and tension
leg platforms. But even with a high degree of
ﬂexibility, they retain all the capabilities of conventional coiled tubing units.
This advanced system improves the overall
safety of coiled tubing operations; with a proven
15 percent increase in operational efﬁciency, a
substantial reduction in boat lifts, and 30 percent

fewer offshore personnel. The design of the
equipment package features fewer mechanical
connections, improved control room ergonomics,
and faster well-to-well cycle times. Compared to
earlier systems, CT SEAS systems can also run
heavier coiled tubing at increased speeds.
CT TCOMP* advanced coiled tubing motioncompensation system is made speciﬁcally for
deepwater use. It is the result of a two-year ﬁeld
study to identify the potential safety and efﬁciency that could be gained by improving the design
and packaging of compensation equipment. The

result is a total motion-compensation package
for deepwater CT operations.
CT TCOMP system trims up to 16 hours from
the average 87 hours it takes to rig up and rig
down a standard deepwater CT system, and it
is safer than other CT packages. It protects wellhead integrity during CT operations by limiting
wellhead stresses, and by compensating for vertical and horizontal wellhead motion from inside or
outside the derrick. And since the equipment rigs
up quickly, it can be used on some spars (caisson
vessels) and TLPs where conventional coiled tubing systems would be too expensive to use.

ACTive services –
a breakthrough in
CT technology
In May 2008, Schlumberger introduced the
ACTive family of coiled tubing services for onshore
and offshore use. This innovative suite of downhole coiled tubing services provides continuous
feedback that allows engineers—either at the well
or in remote locations—to measure, interpret and
act on downhole events in real time.
All previous systems relied on surface data and
feedback from the well to determine what was
happening downhole. Downhole pressure was
estimated from pressure readings at the pump,
the wellhead or both. Actual tool depth was inferred from the amount of coiled tubing in the
hole, which is only accurate to within about 0.3
percent. When jobs required greater accuracy,
crews might tag a known bottom or restriction,
use tubing tail locators, or run mud-pulse telemetry logging tools. These techniques, however,
are inaccurate, expensive and time consuming,
and they can complicate the job.
The ACTive difference is a rugged, highbandwidth ﬁber optic cable inside its own
nickel-chromium-based super-alloy steel carrier
that is deployed inside the coiled tubing string.
The ﬁber optic cable links bottomhole sensors
with surface monitors and controls, allowing
specialists to measure, interpret and act on
downhole events as they occur.
The complete system includes a bottomhole
assembly, ﬁber optic carrier, surface electronics

8

and software that delivers internal and external
pressure, temperature, casing collar locator
depth correlation, and distributed temperature
measurements that provide data back to surface
in real time.
ACTive services can elevate the performance,
efﬁciency and results of coiled tubing operations
in various types of wells. Operators in western
Canada, for example, need cost-effective ways
to achieve maximum reservoir contact in their
partially depleted carbonate reservoirs. Multilateral completions give them greater reservoir
contact and the ability to reach isolated parts
of the reservoir without excessive construction
cost or complexity. Conventional coiled tubing
services are often used to access and treat these
multilateral wells, but without accurate depth
information, it can be hard to conﬁrm access in
all the laterals. Operators not only have to correctly orient the bottomhole assembly to enter
the lateral, they must ﬁrst determine which lateral
they are entering. For them, ACTive services represent a step change in CT capabilities.
ACTive services give operators the tools they need
to diagnose and respond to changing conditions
in real time. To take full advantage, Schlumberger
ﬁelds a team of CT experts who stand ready to
diagnose and respond, based on their knowledge,
experience and the information they get from
ACTive real-time downhole measurements.

As Schlumberger experts monitor the well,
Decipher* dynamic evaluation software provides
the information they need to cross-reference
what they see downhole with surface and petrophysical data. For the ﬁrst time, adjustments to
job parameters are based on immediate feedback from the job in progress. Changes can be
made decisively and with greater conﬁdence
than ever before.

The ACTive portfolio
There are six services in the ACTive portfolio.
Each presents its own unique solution in the
market by combining advanced, high data-rate

10

telemetry, ﬁber optics and real-time downhole
measurements with state-of-the-art interpretation software.

ACTive Matrix monitors
the injection rates, downhole
pressures and temperatures of
matrix treatments to promote
the penetration of ﬂuids,
enhance diversion and optimize
treatment volumes. The service
also aids in the design of
subsequent treatments.

ACTive Cleanout is a
ﬁll-removal service that uses
differential pressure readings to
avoid formation damage and
minimize the number of trips in
and out of the well. It also reduces the total operating time
by optimizing ﬂuid volumes and
penetration rates into the ﬁll.

ACTive Isolation provides
efﬁcient, on-depth settings of
isolation devices in a single run.
It allows operators to insure the
integrity of the seals by controlling both the inﬂation pressure
and the differential pressure
across the sealing elements.
ACTive Isolation can also be
used to accurately place ﬂuids
for temporary operations or to
permanently isolate zones, all
in one trip in the hole.

ACTive Lift improves the
time and ﬂuid efﬁciency of nitrogen lift jobs by continuously
monitoring pressure in the
wellbore. The result is a faster,
more controlled restoration of
production, without the risk of
producing excessive sand and
debris from the reservoir. This
service also aids in the characterization of ﬁeld performance
and the evaluation of artiﬁcial
lift programs.

ACTive Perf achieves accurate depth control in a single
run and ensures full coverage
of the target zone. Controlling
the hydrostatic balance avoids
damage to the formation,
and prevents the invasion of
formation ﬂuids and sand into
the wellbore. Veriﬁcation that
the perforating guns have
been activated improves the
safety and reliability of CT
perforating jobs.

ACTive Proﬁling enhances
all ACTive services with DTS
proﬁling to provide a 3D
temperature proﬁle of the
entire wellbore to monitor the
placement of treatment ﬂuids
and production performance
of the well. Temperature
proﬁling also gives operators
the ability to perform active
point measurements and DTS
spatial measurements on the
same run.

ACTive case studies
I n c r e a s e d s t i m u l a t i o n c ov e r a g e o f a m u l t i l a t e r a l g a s we l l :
When an operator in Canada needed to increase the productivity of two openhole legs in an existing multilateral gas well, they turned to ACTive Matrix for a solution. The well, which is in a naturally fractured dolomite formation, was producing a high concentration of H2S and some CO2.
Coiled tubing was run in the hole to obtain downhole measurements, which were used to
stimulate the openhole legs. Acid treatments temporarily diverted and treated the sections of the
open hole that would otherwise not have been stimulated. Pre- and post-treatment distributed
temperature survey (DTS) data were used to optimize acid placement.
Using the more reliable real-time bottomhole pressure measurements, rather than surface pressure measurements, increased the accuracy and effectiveness of the stimulation treatments.
The initial acid treatment was conﬁrmed. Injection points and other zones to be opened were
identiﬁed. Thermal analysis results were used to generate a revised pump schedule that provided
details of the appropriate diverter and acid stages, which allowed temporary diversion of the
initially stimulated zones and better overall treatment of the multilateral leg.
A ﬁnal DTS conﬁrmed that the treatment successfully diverted the acid and stimulated all of the
targeted zones.

A c c u r a t e p l a c e m e n t f o r a s u c c e s s f u l wa t e r s h u t o f f :
Saudi Aramco chose ACTive Isolation when a 60 percent water cut caused one of its new horizontal wells to stop ﬂowing. Most of the water was coming from the toe of the openhole completion.
ACTive Isolation* provided a coiled tubing solution by allowing operators to deploy an inﬂatable
packer through the production tubing and a cement plug to isolate the water-producing zone.
An initial CT run conﬁrmed accessibility and revealed an accurate downhole temperature,
which was needed to prepare the cement slurry. On the second run, the through-tubing inﬂatable
packer was deployed to the depth of the oil/water interface. After conﬁrming the depth, a ball was
dropped in the coiled tubing to set the packer, and real-time measurements conﬁrmed that the
packer was properly located and set. A third run spotted cement on top of the inﬂatable packer.
Kill ﬂuids were displaced with nitrogen, which was conﬁrmed at the surface by monitoring the
downhole pressure. With the well back in production, the water cut decreased by 50 percent and
oil production increased by 1,000 barrels per day.

ACTive case studies
Effective sand cleanout:

Talisman Malaysia Ltd. (TML) drilled a water injector well in Malaysian waters of the South China
Sea. After perforating the ﬁrst zone, produced sand plugged the next perforating intervals. Despite
efforts to clean the well using conventional CT methods, the planned intervals could not be
reached. Injecting nitrogen to circulate ﬂuids and ﬂow the well only produced more sand.
The operator chose ACTive Cleanout and ACTive Perf to obtain real-time downhole measurements, which allowed better control of the cleanout and accurate placement of the perforating guns.
The existing sand in the wellbore was lifted out by keeping the bottomhole pressure balanced or
slightly overbalanced using real-time bottomhole pressure data. The designed pumping schedule
was then followed with continuous real-time monitoring of the pressure and temperature. Before
continuing with the planned perforation run, an injectivity test ensured that the tunnels in the existing perforation interval were open.
Perforating resumed, with the guns successfully conveyed to the target depth and correlated
against the base depth log. The real-time bottomhole pressure reading assured operators that
they were maintaining the proper balance to keep additional sand from entering the wellbore.
Using the real-time CCL correlations, the guns were positioned. The e-Fire* electronic ﬁring head
system was activated via nitrogen pulses through the coiled tubing. Both the bottomhole pressure
and temperature increased after the guns were ﬁred.
ACTive services allowed operators to effectively clean sand from the well, accurately place the
perforating guns, ﬁne-tune the bottomhole pressure and receive feedback at the surface once
the guns were ﬁred. As a result, the ﬁnal water injectivity rate was 8,900 bbl/d at 700 psi surface
pressure, which conﬁrmed that sand was not reintroduced into the wellbore after the perforating
operations were complete.

ACTive case studies
Identifying the causes of lost production:

When production dropped in a well that was completed using an openhole slotted liner in the
Bunga Raya ﬁeld, the operator, Talisman Malaysia Ltd. (TML), performed a chemical treatment to
remove the emulsion and polymers left behind by the drilling ﬂuid used to drill the well. Immediately
after the treatment, production increased from 500 bbl/d to 2,000 bbl/d, but within ﬁve hours, it
dropped dramatically and then stabilized at its pretreatment rate.
TML suspected that the emulsions and asphaltenes had formed in the wellbore during the
shut-in time while rigging down. However, the operators did not have adequate information about
the formation characteristics and the trajectory of the well. Without the data, they could not
understand the cause of the production decline after treatment, where and how the emulsions and
asphaltenes were forming, and how to dissolve them or prevent them from reforming.
TML asked Schlumberger to design a well cleanup plan, to obtain pressurized bottomhole
samples, and to run a DTS. ACTive Proﬁling was chosen to provide a single-point temperature
reading at the tool and to provide a temperature reading across the ﬁber optic cable used to
deliver the DTS measurements.
The objectives were to check the conformance of the ﬁrst DTS results and interpretation, to use
the DTS data to select the location for collecting representative bottomhole hydrocarbon samples
and to optimize the treatment interval.
The pressure survey and DTS data revealed minimum pressure support from the water injector,
which, in turn, caused the gas cap to expand. Temperature dropped across the entire interval, but
was lowest at the toe. The cooling effect and subsequent drop in liquid production was caused
by gas coming from the heel and toe of the well as the gas cap expanded. The combination of
gas rates with oil and water production was also creating a tight, viscous emulsion that further
hindered the well’s performance.
TML concluded that with this well, due to the horizontal openhole slotted-liner completion, the
high gas production from the toe and heel could not be selectively shut off or controlled.

ACTive case studies
Using downhole measurements to boost well perfor mance:

Talisman Malaysia Ltd. operates more than 130 wells in the South China Sea, but many of them
do not perform to full potential because of perforation damage at suboptimal reservoir conditions.
Initial attempts to solve the damage problem involved CT perforating with the well in an underbalanced condition. The main advantages of CT were the ability to lower the bottomhole pressure
using nitrogen and a lower overall cost when compared to tubing-conveyed perforating using a
standard rig.
Although conventional CT methods were considered effective in this application, concerns
included perforating off-depth due to inaccurate depth control, an inability to detect ﬁred guns
and improper pressure balance in the well. Too much pressure in the wellbore could result in an
ineffective cleaning of the perforations and too little pressure could cause the guns to be sanded
in after they ﬁred.
ACTive Perf was selected because the service provides downhole measurements, tools and
techniques to perforate in properly balanced conditions. It also allows the accurate placement of
the guns, a pressure activated electronic ﬁring head system and the ability to receive real-time
conﬁrmation that the guns have ﬁred.
The ACTive Perf system was used to complete a TML offshore gas well. The perforating gun
was positioned on depth using real-time CCL correlation. Prejob calculations showed that the
correct underbalance would be reached after the displacement of wellbore ﬂuid with nitrogen.
However, when real-time pressure data showed that the desired underbalance pressure had not
been achieved, operators were able to respond immediately to correct the problem.
Nitrogen pulses were sent down through the coiled tubing to ﬁre the guns. Downhole measurements quickly showed an increase in bottomhole temperature and pressure, which conﬁrmed a
successful ﬁring.
By perforating under optimal reservoir conditions, TML achieved a higher-than-expected and
sand-free gas production rate of 70 MMcf/d.

Company Profile

Tenaris offers the most diverse line of coiled tubing for downhole applications
Tenaris is th
the leading manufacturer of coiled tubing products worldwide. At its two Houston
facilities, the company manufactures coiled tubing and coiled line pipe in a range of sizes and
grades, including
inclu
corrosion resistant alloys for sour service environments. As a result of Tenaris’
capabilities, Schlumberger chose the company to be its exclusive provider of coiled tubing for
their global ccoiled tubing services organization.
Tenaris hhas differentiated its product offerings by not only supplying coiled tubing strings used
for downhole production-related coiled tubing services, but also through manufacturing of larger
coiled tubing that may be utilized for marine pipeline requirements. The company is the world’s
ﬁrst tube or pipe manufacturing facility to obtain ISO-9001 certiﬁcation for its quality assurance
programs. Te
Tenaris is the world’s only supplier of 4 ½-in. and 5-in. OD coiled tubing and the sole
provider of hheavy wall coiled tubing with available thickness from 0.224-in. to 0.300-in.
Addition
Additionally, Tenaris operates the world’s only dedicated three-layer continuous coating line
for coiled lin
line pipe, consisting of fusion bonded epoxy, copolymer adhesive and polyethylene
polypropylene. The coiled line pipe is delivered on spools to marine vessels where they are
or polypropy
consolidated to enable the vessel to pay out the tubing signiﬁcantly faster compared with constick pipe welded joint by joint and laid by a traditional pipelay vessel.
ventional stic
Coiled liline pipe typically is used in water depths of 200-3,000 ft. with one Gulf of Mexico
installation in
i more than 7,000 ft. of water and other projects in locations from Norway to
Zealand. Tenaris also pioneered the API 5LCP coiled line pipe certiﬁcation standards, and
New Zealand
continues to be the only certiﬁed supplier.

Optimizin manufacturing process
Optimizing
Tenaris’ co
coiled tubing plant in Houston went through a debottlenecking and expansion program from late 2005
spring 2007, signiﬁcantly improving workﬂow as well as adding the latest technology to increase production
through sp
efﬁciency. The expansion project also improved service handling and simpliﬁed truck trafﬁc ﬂow through the plant.
Improvements included increased assembly lines, additional assembly consolidation wheels, which dramatically

coiled tubing strings, and additional hydro test bays were built. The expansion program increased output by
75%-80% and signiﬁcantly reduced backorder time. There also is additional infrastructure to allow for further
expansion, including a third mill and bias welding cells as well as room for onsite master coil slitting.
Tenaris continuously works with other innovative companies to develop new applications for coiled tubing
and coiled line pipe. The forward thinking company is currently testing the applicability of large diameter coiled
line pipe for marine riser applications, unique artiﬁcial lift products, and tubular products as subcomponents for
more advanced production equipment for tertiary and SAG-D production.
Tenaris is a leading supplier of tubes and related services for the world’s energy industry and certain other
industrial applications. Its mission is to deliver value to its customers through product development, manufacturing excellence and supply chain management. The company minimizes risk for its customers and helps them
reduce costs, increase ﬂexibility and improve time-to-market. Tenaris’ employees around the world are committed to continuous improvement by sharing knowledge across a single global organization.

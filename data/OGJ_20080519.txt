Why Produce
Diesel from the
Vacuum Unit?
Look ahead five years. The economy is likely to keep tightening
and the rush to control pollution
will inevitably be accompanied
by demands for greater energy
conservation. Consequence? A
growing market for diesel which
yields more energy per unit
volume. Yet many continue to
believe that producing diesel
from the vacuum unit is poor
design—that it should be produced only from the atmospheric
column. Hence many refiners

PROCESS

CONSULTING
SERVICES,INC.

Also: eliminating diesel from
vacuum unit feed cuts vacuum
gas oil (VGO) yield because
it is more difficult to vaporize
the feed in the vacuum column
flash zone. If atmospheric diesel
recovery is very high, VGO yield
is low. As crudes get heavier
it is essential to leave some
diesel in the vacuum column
feed to achieve reasonable VGO
cutpoints.
Lastly, if you process Canadian
oils sands Dilbit and Synbit, you
can’t run the atmospheric heater
hotter than 680°F resulting in very
high diesel boiling range material
in the vacuum feed. To obtain reasonable diesel recovery from the
whole crude you must produce it
in the vacuum unit.

feed 20-30% diesel boiling range
material to their FCCs or hydrocrackers. But where most motor
fuel is diesel, refiners have long
known that producing vacuum
unit diesel can increase production up to 5 volume percent on
whole crude.
Maximum diesel production is
simply not possible in the
atmospheric column because
flash zone temperature would
need to be 760°F or higher.
Moreover, the inherent reflux
rate below the diesel draw results
in molar L/V ratio less than 0.15.
But in vacuum columns it can be
0.4 or higher. And distillation is
driven by L/V!

OpX – Energy Efficiency Initiative, European Refiner.
In the first phase, KBC conducted a review of the Mesoamérican hydrocarbon
markets, KBC holds a long-term working relationship with a client, which operates
a medium-complexity refinery along the coast of Romania. In an effort to improve
the performance and profitability of its operations, the refiner decided to
undertake an Energy Efficiency Improvement Initiative. The work consisted of:



Benchmarking of Refinery Energy Performance
Gap Analysis of Areas of Inefficiency
Fired Heater Assessment
Steam/Power System Modelling and Optimisation
Selective Process Unit Energy Optimisation, including:
- Selected Heat Integration (Pinch) Studies
- Process Unit Simulation (using KBC Petro-SIM™) and Optimisation
 Equipment-level Analysis (furnaces, turbines, exchangers, fouling)
After the analysis was complete, KBC presented recommendations to the client, and
within four months, the refiner reported that the benefits implemented and achieved
amounted to USD$4.3 Million/year. KBC was also able to help the client move from
the 3rd quartile to the 2nd quartile of energy efficiency among over 200 other
refiners surveyed by KBC around the world.

OPEC: Reﬁnery mismatch strains crude price
Refinery construction oriented to gasoline in a market needing
distillate is lifting the premium for light crude and contributing
to market instability, says the Organization of Petroleum Exporting
Countries.
In its May Monthly Oil Market Report, OPEC says global refinery
construction during 2000-07 favored conversion capacity associated with gasoline while demand growth for the product was less
than half that of distillate.
During this period, demand for distillate increased by 5.2 million b/d while that for gasoline rose by 2 million b/d and use of
fuel oil declined.
At the same time, refiners added 1.2 million b/d of fluid catalytic cracking and coking capacity, associated with gasoline, but
only 700,000 b/d of hydrocracking capacity, related to distillate.
Recently, demand for distillate has surged because of economic
resilience in developing countries and the increased use of diesel
generators, OPEC says. With insufficient distillate-oriented conversion capacity in place, refiners must rely on increased runs of light
crude.
The result, OPEC says, is a widening price differential between
light and heavy crude grades. The difference in price between
heavy Maya crude and West Texas Intermediate, for example, has
grown from about $8/bbl in June 2007 to more than $20/bbl at
the beginning of May.
“The persistent mismatch between the product demand pattern
and the refinery configuration has focused further upward pressure on light crude prices,” OPEC says. “Downstream constraints
are continuing to contribute to the high risk premium for these
grades, leaving the market increasingly sensitive to any disruption
in light crude supplies.”

Aussie budget closes condensate tax loophole
Australia’s federal budget has closed a tax loophole, ending an
excise exemption worth more than $500,000 on the production
of condensate.
Biggest losers are the North West Shelf joint venture partners,
which have been producing the gas fields off Western Australia for
the past 25 years. Condensate has been a lucrative byproduct obtained with little effort.
However the new Labor Party government reported that it will
remove the oil excise exemption for condensate. The move is expected to add $564 million (Aus.) to federal government revenue
during the next financial year (2008-09) and about $2.5 billion
over the next 4 years.
Condensate production from NWS fields and those onshore will
be subject to the same excise rates as those applicable to all petro-

— Q u i c k Ta k e s

leum fields discovered since Sept. 18, 1975.
Under previous arrangements the first 30 million bbl of oil produced from a field was exempt from excise duty. Past production of
condensate will now contribute to reaching that threshold.
Western Australia also is a loser as two thirds of the excise went
to the state government under the old scheme. However the federal
government said it will compensate the state for lost revenue, beginning with an initial $80 million this financial year and building
to a total of $406 million over 4 years.
Not surprisingly, industry is unhappy with the change. Belinda
Robinson, chief executive officer of the Australian Petroleum Production & Exploration Association, said industry was surprised by
the government’s move and concerned at the absence of any prior
consultation.
“Given the magnitude of the investments involved and the important contribution of the petroleum industry to the Australian
economy, a strong partnership between industry and government
is critical,” Robinson said. “Investment decisions are made on the
basis of certainty that fiscal frameworks agreed with governments
will underpin the long-term economic viability of projects.”

Sudan rebels vow more attacks on Khartoum
Risks to energy installations and their personnel in Sudan will
increase in the next few months, particularly for Chinese oil companies operating in the southwest region of the African country,
said Tahir Elfaki, head of the legislative council of Sudan’s rebel
group Justice and Equality Movement.
JEM rebels attacked the nation’s capital Khartoum on May 10
and plan to continue launching new attacks on the city, aiming to
destabilize the government until it falls, Elfaki said.
He also said JEM is planning operations against oil fields operated by state-owned China National Petroleum Corp. in the central province of Kordofan. Last December, JEM rebels said they attacked the Defra oil facility in south Kordofan (OGJ Online, Dec.
21, 2007).
In London, risk analyst Exclusive Analysis (EA) confirmed that
additional attacks by the rebels on Khartoum as well as on energy
assets in Kordofan “are likely in the next couple of months.”
Confirming the May 10 attack on Khartoum, EA said a rebel column of 50-100 vehicles left JEM’s stronghold in Jebel Moun, near
the Chadian border in West Darfur, and advanced on the capital,
picking up reinforcements along the way.
“After a day of heavy fighting in Omdurman—a suburb across
the Nile to the west of the city center—they were repelled by the
army,” it said.
The analyst also commented on JEM’s threats to increase attacks
on energy and economically viable assets, especially in south Kordofan.

“Although a large-scale attack on an oil installation would be
costly to JEM in terms of loss of lives, the attack on Khartoum
shows a willingness to take such losses if the operation is thought
to further their strategic aims,” EA said.
It said members of JEM are “particularly well placed” to stage
attacks in Kordofan, where they have experience operating and
where the state presence is more limited, but they are likely to
reach beyond this area as well to show their capability.

OTC: Deepwater systems offer new life in gulf
The ultradeep waters of the Gulf of Mexico will be an area of
significant oil production in the future, according to Steve Thurston, vice-president of Chevron North America Exploration & Production Co.
At least four projects are expected to come on stream within the
next 5 years, including Royal Dutch Shell PLC’s Perdido, Petroleo
Brasileiro SA’s (Petrobras) Cascada, Chevron’s St. Malo and Jack,
and BP PLC’s Kaskida. The gulf has produced about 1 million b/d
from its shelf for the past 30 years, but these reserves are now in
decline, Thurston noted May 8 at a luncheon during the Offshore
Technology Conference in Houston.

Development

Nine E&P permits awarded off W. Australia
Australia has awarded nine new offshore leases, receiving a total of $425 million (Aus.) in its most recent exploration acreage
release. The permits cover a range of prospects, water depths, and
play types. Five are in the Bonaparte basin, three in the Browse
basin, and one in the Carnarvon basin.
France’s Total SA won 22% of the acreage with a substantial $94
million work program over 3 years plus $6 million in secondary
work commitments for newly awarded Browse basin permit WA408-P off northwest Western Australia.
Total beat three other bidders to win WA-408-P. Its program
guarantees 1,300 sq km of new 3D seismic work, three exploration wells, and geotechnical studies in the first 3 permit years. The
secondary program consists of further geotechnical studies.
Chinese company Sinopec won NT/P76 in the Troubador Terrace area of the Bonaparte with a guaranteed initial work program
of $35.65 consisting of geotechnical studies, 500 km of 2D seismic reprocessing, 2,000 km of new 2D work, and 1,000 sq km
of 3D. The company also bid $38.5 million on a secondary work
program comprising one well and geotechnical studies.
Apache and Total won Bonaparte Block AC/P42, with a $18.9
million primary program and $30.2 million secondary work, and
AC/P43 with a $32.95 million program and $300,000 worth of
secondary work.
Finder Exploration Pty. Ltd., Perth, won AC/P44 and AC/P45
with more modest bids.
Of the other two Browse permits, a partnership of Santos, Chevron, and Inpex won WA-410-P with a low $760,000 bid for some
3D seismic and geotechnical studies followed by a secondary program of one well and geotechnical and marketing studies valued
at $30.5 million.
Santos, Inpex, and Beach Petroleum combined to win WA8

Jack holds 3 billion bbl in place and Chevron has tested 6,000
b/d of oil. It will carry out further appraisal after gathering 350 ft
of net pay. So far several companies have made 14 discoveries in the
Lower Tertiary system, or a 58% success rate.
Thurston said this trend would require breakthrough technology to produce hydrocarbons in an efficient and cost effective
manner. “The reservoirs are very large and spread out. We need to
aggregate the fluid into one host so flow assurance is a big issue.
Other challenges are long distance subsea tiebacks, life cycle water
management and small fields will need to get in earlier rather than
later.”
Operators are completing wells at 1,200 ft and want to reduce
the cost and number of days needed. The trend is challenging as
operators must overcome from top to bottom during drilling hurricanes, currents, unstable mud, thick salt layers, and high pressures and temperatures. “Other than that, it’s pretty easy,” Thurston
said. Wilcox alone, in 5,000-10,000 ft of water, has a 10,000-ft
salt layer.
Chevron plans to drill 13 wells on Wilcox over the coming
years. It is looking at different technologies to cut investment costs,
increase production rates, and reduce key uncertainties. ✦

411-P with an initial program worth $1.46 million followed by
a secondary program, including a $30.5 million program of one
well and geotechnical and marketing studies.
Carnarvon basin permit WA-409-P went to Australian independent Cue Exploration and Gascorp Australia for an initial $3 million
program of seismic work and a secondary $25.5 million program
to drill one well and conduct geotechnical studies.

Norway invites bids for mature offshore acreage
Norway has invited operators to bid for mature acreage in the
Norwegian North Sea, Norwegian Sea, and the Barents Sea under
its Awards in Predefined Areas (APA) 2008 round.
This year operators can apply for all or part of 18 blocks, 11 of
which are in the North Sea, 3 in the Norwegian Sea, and 4 in the
Barents Sea. The APA initiative is important in attracting new and
smaller companies to the Norwegian Continental Shelf.
“The area announced in APA 2008 consists mainly of returned
blocks where petroleum activities have previously taken place,”
the Norwegian Petroleum Ministry said. “The purpose of the APArounds is to enhance exploration activities in mature areas, where
expectations are [for] smaller discoveries that cannot justify an independent development. It is therefore good resource management
to discover and develop these resources before existing infrastructure in connection to other fields are shut down.”
The deadline for applications is midday on Oct. 3, and the Norwegian Petroleum Ministry will award the blocks by late 2008 or
early 2009.

team, with the former unit being responsible for the drilling operation. ✦

Production

Eni delays Kashagan oil ﬁeld production further
Kazakhstan, learning of additional delays in the development
of its Kashagan oil field, may impose new fines on the Eni SPA-led
consortium in charge of the project.
Eni notified the government of the delays, and officials are evaluating possible sanctions, but have not made a final decision, according to a senior official of the Kazakh oil ministry.
The consortium proposed postponing the production start to
2012-13 from 2011, according to Kazakh Energy Minister Sauat
Mynbayev, who said the two sides were trying to “come to an
agreement again.”
Industry analysts say the field’s development poses unusual
challenges, including temperatures that range from 40° C. in the
summer to–40° C. in the winter.
Kashagan’s crude also has high hydrogen-sulfide content, making it potentially deadly for workers on site and raising unusually
difficult environmental problems.
Owing to the challenges, in January Eni set a new date of 2011
for first production of Kashagan oil, following two earlier delays. At
the time, the consortium agreed to compensate the Kazakh government for the cost overruns and production delays occasioned by 6
months of talks.
The government claimed that the delays in the Kashagan project
were undermining the nation’s financial plans and preventing it
from implementing other developments in the country.
Under the agreement reached in January, Eni will no longer be
sole operator once production begins but will share that role with
partners ExxonMobil Corp., Royal Dutch Shell PLC, and Total SA
(OGJ Online, Feb. 3, 2008).
Also in January, the partners agreed to sell part of their Kashagan
stakes to KazMunaiGas, giving the Kazakh state oil company a
16.81% stake in the project and to make additional payments to
the Kazakh government based on the price of oil.
At the end of April, Eni Chief Executive Officer Paolo Scaroni said
the consortium was talking with the Kazakh government about an
updated plan for Kashagan, and it had hoped to reach an agreement
by then. Scarloni said discussion had focused on the need to agree
to a date specifying when field production would begin.
Eni expects Kashagan’s output to reach 370,000 b/d when it
eventually comes online and to reach peak production of 1.5 million b/d by 2019.

Sea field to begin production this year. Shell operates the field and
holds 100% interest.
Shamrock field was developed using Shell’s proprietary Monotower platform powered by wind and solar energy, which costs
much less to build than a traditional offshore platform. John Gallagher, technical vice-president for Shell Exploration & Production,
Europe, said Shamrock was brought on stream shortly after Starling
and Caravel fields earlier this year. “Our ability to use latest generation technology has enabled Shell to develop a field that would
once have been uneconomic,” Gallagher said.
Starling, a subsea tieback to the Shearwater platform in the
Central North Sea, came on stream in January, and Caravel—also
a Monotower platform development—produced initial gas Apr.
30.
Production capacity through the Shamrock monotower will
average 120 MMscfd, Shell said. Gas is transported by pipeline to
the Shell-operated Bacton gas plant about 120 km to the southwest.
Shell UK operates fields in the UK sector of the North Sea on
behalf of itself, Esso, and other partners.

Shell, Repsol drop Iranian development plans

Royal Dutch Shell PLC and Repsol-YPF SA have suspended plans
to develop Phase 13 of South Pars gas field in Iran as relations between the US and Iran deteriorate and development costs rise.
US sanctions against Iran have made it increasingly difficult for
foreign investors to develop the proposed $10 billion LNG export
plant, but the companies have signalled an intention to look at
other types of involvement in Iran at a later date. The US Congress
is worried about Iran’s nuclear program.
A Shell spokesperson said that the company agreed to swap the
development for “alternative suitable phases.”
According to media reports, a Repsol-YPF source was quoted
saying that the companies want to exchange their participation
in Block 13 for a role in Blocks 20 or 21 due to rising development costs.
Other replacement candidates for the partners could be OAO
Gazprom and certain Asian companies. As Iran has huge gas potential holding the second largest proven natural gas reserves in
the world, the majors have been reluctant to shun it completely
despite pressure from Iran to commit to a development date. The
country has published proven natural gas in-place of more than

Construction begins on Nghi Son reﬁnery in Vietnam

Venezuela, Ecuador to seek bids for reﬁnery

Construction has begun on Vietnam’s $6 billion Nghi Son refinery and petrochemical project in Thanh Hoa province, following directives issued by the country’s prime minister Nguyen Tan
Dung.
At groundbreaking, Nguyen said the Nghi Son complex and
the Dung Quat refinery, also under construction, will jointly meet
some 60% of the country’s demand for petroleum products.
Output from the Nghi Son refinery complex is expected to
reach 200,000 b/d, with products to include gasoline A92, A95,
A98, diesel, kerosine, fuel for reaction engines, and paraxylene.
The Dung Quat refinery, the first of its kind in Vietnam, is slated
to begin operating in February 2009, according to Truong Van Tuyen, head of the refinery’s management board.
Authorities plan to begin trial runs at the Dung Quat refinery
later this month, with all tests due to be completed by August, according to a report in the Saigon Liberation newspaper.

Venezuelan and Ecuadoran state-owned oil and gas companies
Petroleos de Venezuela SA and Petroecuador plan to form a joint
venture company to build and operate a 300,000 b/d refinery on
Ecuador’s Pacific Coast.
Petroecuador said the planned Pacific Refinery-CEM, to be
owned 51% by Ecuador and 49% by Venezuela, will ask foreign
companies to bid on constructing the refinery, requiring them to
finance 70% of its construction.
Petroecuador, which did not set a date for bidding to start, said
the winner would be compensated after construction, possibly
with a fee-for-service payment or a temporary share of the refinery’s earnings.
Last year, Ecuadorean President Rafael Correa said the proposed
Pacific refinery, to be built in the coastal province of Manabi, would
cost around $5 billion, increasing to $10 billion if the partners
decided to add a petrochemical plant on the site. ✦

Tr a n s p o r t a t i o n
Odessa-Brody oil line reversal nears completion
The Odessa-Brody oil pipeline will start carrying light crude
oil in its originally-planned direction from the Caspian Sea toward
Europe this summer, according to a senior Ukrainian official.
Oleh Dubyna, chairman of state oil and gas company Naftohaz
Ukrayiny, expects the pipeline to carry Caspian crude by July, saying
that state oil pipeline operator Ukrtransnafta already is purchasing
485,000 tonnes of light oil to facilitate the pipeline’s reversal.
The Odessa-Brody pipeline was originally built to transport
light Caspian crude oil to Europe, but it has never operated as
planned. Instead, it has worked in the reverse direction, carrying
Russian oil to Odessa.
The planned reversal is part of a larger project aimed at extending the Odessa-Brody pipeline and using it to supply Europe with
oil from the Caspian Sea region.
Last October, five former members of the Russia-dominated
former Union of Soviet Socialist Republics—Azerbaijan, Georgia,
Lithuania, Poland, and Ukraine—agreed to set up the so-called “Samartia” consortium (OGJ Online, Oct. 12, 2007).
Its goal is to enable transportation of oil from the Caspian Sea
region, particularly Azerbaijan and possibly Kazakhstan, through
Poland to markets in western Europe.
The countries in the Samartia consortium want to diversify
Europe’s sources of oil. Most European countries rely heavily on
supplies from Russia, but they fear that Russia could leverage its
near-monopoly status for political advantage.
In April, oil company officials from Ukraine and Poland signed
an agreement authorizing a feasibility study for a new oil network
that would extend the Odessa-Brody pipeline from Ukraine to Poland.

— Q u i c k Ta k e s

The plan calls for the extension of the pipeline to the central
Polish city of Plock, site of the country’s largest refinery, allowing
new supplies to be shipped onward to Poland’s Baltic Sea port of
Gdansk.

OTC: US must pay more to attract gas storage
US natural gas markets will have to compete in price in global
gas markets if they expect to attract sufficient supplies into storage
before the country’s gas withdrawal season traditionally begins on
Nov. 1.
That was the main message of David Thames, president of Cheniere Marketing, as he spoke to a luncheon audience May 8, the
final day of the Offshore Technology Conference in Houston. And
he believes historically high prices for this time of the year suggest
US markets will respond.
Arguing the primacy of LNG as the fuel most likely to fill the
import demand, Thames cited the flat growth in domestic natural
gas production despite rising gas rig counts and prospects for falling gas imports from Canada. The result, he said, will be a 5-8 bcfd
deficit the US will face.
New shale plays will not be as productive as the Barnett has
been, Thames said. Many are requiring years to reach modest levels
of a few hundred million cubic feet/day.
LNG, on the other hand, as exemplified by Cheniere’s newly
opened Sabine Pass terminal stands ready to send out large amounts
of gas into storage or electric power market. Again, price is the key,
Thames said.
Recent US prices have hit more than $11/Mcf, compared with
contracts in Asia-Pacific nearing $20/MMbtu, as US markets respond to growing demand for gas. ✦

Biofuels and food
I believe that blaming biofuels for
high feedstuff prices is simplistic.
Much has been written recently about
the negative societal impact of developed
nations’ adoption of biofuels and its direct impact on food prices. Making ethanol from corn is inefficient compared to
Brazilian sugar cane. US energy policy,
including import duties on ethanol, has
increased corn and soy prices, but it is
not the only culprit.
Spring 2007’s flooding in Kansas
and Oklahoma and Australia’s summer drought were natural events which
impacted wheat prices. And so are the
rising needs of a growing global population and Southeast China’s January
floods. What has received little attention
to date is the inflow of highly speculative capital from new, non-commodityrelated, investors. This disturbing trend
is facilitated by the newfound correlation between energy values and corn/
soybeans. The higher return currently
provided to farmers will more than
likely lead to a precipitous reversal when
overextended participants finally liquidate positions.
I believe fund dollars have caused
more damage than biofuels use. Wheat
prices have soared to unnecessary levels
due to being swept into fund speculation.
And I know that global grain stocks
were on a downward trend long before
the biofuels push. Despite discussions
among, and warnings from, entities
worried about this condition and its
long-term implications, markets did not
react appropriately—partially due to US
farm programs—to increase output.
The advent of biofuels woke up the
financial community to the prospects of
hedging corn and soy against escalating
hydrocarbon values. That development
brought in far more capital that needed
which, driven by the declining dollar,
escalating US dollar-denominated energy
costs, and an inflationary mindset, led to
escalating corn/soy/palm oil prices and
drug nonenergy grains along.
Is there a parallel to the formerly
escalating housing market? Yes. Hedging
over 70% of the US soybean crop is not
a healthy financial condition.

US gasoline perceptions

David N. Nakamura
Refining/Petrochemical
Editor
With the official start of the summer driving season just a week away, US
drivers are faced with the most expensive gasoline in history. Recent price
trends have changed the behavior of the
typical US driver. The typical driver also
expects the high prices to continue or
even worsen.
Two Gallup Inc. polls conducted during the past month quantify the thinking of US gasoline consumers. Many
are reducing consumption of gasoline
in various ways, spending less on other
goods, and using mass transit. And most
think high gasoline prices are here to
stay and will continue to increase.

Gallup poll

are either changing their driving and
spending habits, or increasing the efficiency of the cars they drive:
• 60% of those polled said they were
“cutting back significantly on household spending,” a rise from 34% in a
2004 poll.
• 84% were consolidating trips or
otherwise cutting back on daily driving.
• 74% said they tried harder to find
less-expensive gas.
• 81% reported driving the most
fuel-efficient car when given a choice.
• 76% had taken steps to increase
mileage of the cars they own, including
driving slower, tuning up their cars, or
using air conditioning less.
• 71% were considering more
fuel-efficient cars for their next vehicle
purchase.
• 62% had shared rides with friends
or neighbors.
• 51% decided to forgo a trip taken
regularly in the past.
• 34% switched to a lower, and lessexpensive, grade of gasoline.
• Only 31% were using mass transit
or other alternative transportation
modes.
Gallup reported that “the prevalence of finding creative ways…to
compensate for the higher price of gas
is inversely correlated with income.”
High-income US drivers, however, are
more likely than lower-income drivers
to consider a more fuel-efficient vehicle
in the future.

In a USA Today/Gallup poll conducted May 2-4, 78% of the 1,017 adult
respondents said they think that the
rise in gasoline prices is a permanent
change. In August 2003, only 33% of
poll respondents felt this way.
When asked if rising prices are causing financial hardships for them or their
families, 71% responded yes, nearly
as high as the 72% affirmative rate in
a similar September 2005 post-HurriGasoline, crude prices
cane Katrina poll. Of the 71% positive

responders, about 35% (equivalent to
25% of the entire population) said that Department of Energy’s Energy Information Administration show an average

Due to these hardships, drivers

gasoline price of $3.72/gal paid by US
consumers. Prices have risen more than
21% from a year-ago average of $3.10/
gal (May 14, 2007) and more than 72%
from an average of $2.16/gal in May
2005.
During the same time period, crude
prices have risen even more dramatically. West Texas Intermediate closed at
$124.24/bbl on May 12; $62.55/bbl
on May 14, 2007; and $48.64/bbl on
May 16, 2005.
A quick calculation shows that the
ratio of gasoline-to-WTI prices has
fallen to about 1.25:1 from year-ago
levels of nearly 2.1:1. Applying the
year-ago ratio to current WTI prices
leads to an equivalent gasoline price of
about $6.16/gal.
And the latest refining margins show
this price divergence—US margins are
down 30-50% from year-ago levels
(OGJ, May 5, 2008, p. 93).
This all means that gasoline prices
are more likely to get worse before
they get better because refiners are less
willing to operate less-profitable units,
especially if crude prices stay on their
current trend.
The May Gallup poll reported that
54% of those polled thought that gasoline would reach $6/gal in the next 5
years. And 19% of those polled thought
gasoline would reach $10/gal sometime during the next 5 years.
Another Gallup poll, conducted Apr.
25-27, reported that 89% of respondents think gasoline prices in their local
area will reach $4/gal this summer,
22% expect prices of $5/gal, and 5%
expect that prices will reach $6/gal.
Time will tell if public perceptions
in this case are prophetic. ✦

Subsidizing oil use
What better symbolizes the modern oil market
than the American sport utility vehicle? The outsize
crowd carrier embodies the unbridled gasoline
consumption and disregard for cost that receive
widespread blame for fuel prices now pressing hard
on consumers and economies. By those parameters,
however, the taxi cab in Jakarta and cooking stove in
Kuala Lumpur deserve comparable scorn.
Indonesia and Malaysia belong to the large group
of countries whose governments cap prices of oil
products and natural gas or otherwise subsidize
consumption. Where prices are controlled, fuel consumers don’t feel the same compulsion to conserve
that their counterparts elsewhere do. It is partly because of this muted price signal that oil consumption continues to rise in the subsidized world as it
falls elsewhere. The effect is strong enough to keep
global oil demand rising, which will keep prices
heading upward until supply catches up.

Developing world
Subsidization of oil and other energy consumption occurs mostly in the developing world.
Elsewhere, oil use is falling.
In its May Oil Market Report, the International
Energy Agency predicts oil consumption will
decline for the third consecutive year during 2008
in all of the industrialized countries represented by
the Organization for Economic Cooperation and
Development (OECD). The projected annual decline
is small—0.7%—in part because of downward
adjustments to IEA’s estimates for OECD demand in
2007. Comparisons between oil use in March 2008
with that of March 2007 show more clearly what’s
happening: down 2.8% in the OECD American and
Pacific regions and down 2.3% in Europe.
In contrast with the OECD declines comes IEA’s
projection for a 3.7% increase in non-OECD oil
use this year. Some of that jump relates to strong
economic performance in Asia and the Middle
East. But some also reflects protection of consumers from the sting of rising oil-product prices in
many developing countries. This increase in the
market segment representing 44% of worldwide
oil consumption is enough to offset the OECD
decline and leave a net projected gain in global
oil consumption, according to IEA, of 1.2%. A
question worth asking is whether oil demand still
would be rising in the absence of developing-

world price ceilings.
Consumption subsidies are as difficult to sustain as they are painful to repeal, especially in poor
countries. Governments must compensate for the
difference between prices at locally controlled levels and higher, free-market levels. Difficulty grows
as market prices rise. Indeed, the new IEA report
documents the strain.
China, for example, has begun compensating
Sinopec and PetroChina for the downstream losses
they incur by selling oil products at capped prices.
The government worries that product shortages
will develop during the Olympic Games next August in Beijing. For now, the Chinese government
can afford the payments. Other Asian governments
aren’t so lucky.
IEA reports that the incoming administration
in Taiwan might lift price controls imposed last
November and cites reports that, if it doesn’t,
the state oil company might be bankrupt in 2
years. In Thailand, the government has reintroduced diesel subsidies, letting refiners offset the
costs by suspending contributions to national oil
and conservation funds. Indonesia is grappling
with the financial pressure created by gasoline,
diesel, and kerosene subsidies estimated to cost
$12 billion this year. Malaysia recently decided
to maintain fuel-price caps despite the costs but,
says IEA, “hopes to target subsidies more effectively.” Vietnam, meanwhile, has frozen oil product
prices until June and will suspend import taxes
and help importers of gas oil, kerosine, and fuel
oil. Although gasoline in Vietnam was supposedly
deregulated last year, importers still must have
government approval to change retail prices.

Other distortions
Asia isn’t the only region where governments
subsidize consumption. IEA also reports distortions caused by market controls in Iran and India.
And subsidizing consumption isn’t the only way
governments manipulate markets. European governments punish consumption with high taxes on
oil products, for example. And the US limits future
supply by restricting access to federal land.
Consumption subsidies nevertheless help
explain why worldwide oil demand keeps rising
despite record-setting price increases. SUVs aren’t
the only reason. ✦

in winter, the lower the emissions will
be.
The very analyses of the agency
therefore show that regardless of the
cost, European policies are ineffective,
thus inefficient. In fact, while emissions
data are made available with a 2-year
delay, verified emissions data related to
the ETS sectors are more quickly available, so it is already possible to draw
preliminary conclusions.

Phased emissions rights
Before the failure of European
policies is assessed, a closer look at the
European market for emissions rights is
needed.
The ETS was created with a directive in 2003, and enforcement began
on Jan. 1, 2005. The ETS identifies two
phases of application: a first pilot phase
during 2005-07 followed by a second
momentum phase in 2008-12 that will
coincide with the Kyoto Protocol applications period during which companies
and countries are called upon to meet
the objective of reducing emissions by
8% below 1990 levels.
At the beginning of each phase, a
certain number of emissions permits is
gratuitously assigned to firms covered
by the ETS. Distribution of the permits
takes place according to a national
allocation plan by which each member state declares the total amount of
the emission quotas that it intends to
distribute within its state. On Apr. 30 of
each year, the plant will have to return a
number of permits equal to its emissions. If it is unable to do so, or if it did
not have a way to buy the extra needed
quotas on the market, it must pay a fine
of €40/tonne of CO2 equivalent emitted above its allotted permit amount in
the first phase and €100/tonne for unpermitted overage in the second phase.
The first phase covers only CO2,
while in the second, the other greenhouse gases identified by the Kyoto
Protocol come into play.1 Once the
fine has been paid, the company is not
exempted from cutting its emissions,
so the €40 and €100 fines respectively
do not work as a cap on carbon price.

Finally, the directive does not allow the
banking of allowances and their transfer
from one phase to another. If the enterprise that holds excess emission quotas
cannot sell them in useful time, their
value crumbles to zero.
From this summary description, the
three main elements of political arbitrariness of the ETS project emerge: the
inclusion of some industries and not
others, the prohibition against banking
the permits, and their gratuitous distribution at the beginning of each phase
on the basis of the historical emission
record in a reference period—the socalled grandfathering.2
Furthermore, the albeit small experience accumulated by ETS gives rise to
perplexities about how well it is operating, with particular regard to the high
volatility of the carbon allowance price.
The price of the allowances, which at
the beginning of the market increased
from the initial €7/tonne to settle
at around €20-25/tonne, suddenly
crashed. The crash coincided with the

publication of the data on emissions by
the ETS industries. The price then shot
up again to more than €20/tonne at the
beginning of 2008 and the beginning
of the second phase, and as this article
is written, a tonne of CO2 is traded at
or above €25. The immediate growth
reflects the prohibition against banking excess permits, which couldn’t be
transferred to 2008-12.
What caused the price volatility,
which has effectively nullified the
predictable cost of the quota system?
According to a Bologna University
Working Paper by Stefano Clô, a phenomenon of “over-allocation” in favor
of the ETS industries has taken place.
The national allocation plans approved
by the Commission for 2008-12
reflect a sensitivity to these issues. For
example, Brussels issued 1,439 permits
vs. the 1,570 requested. But this—and,
in junction the prices of quotas, which
went back to pre-2006 levels—allows
one to predict that the second phase
will have tangible costs for the enter-

The other fundamental choice concerning the third phase is about passage
from grandfathering to auctioning in
the allocation of quotas to guarantee the
“efficiency of the ETS, transparency and

of] undesirable distributional effects.”6

is therefore added the possibility that
further free quotas are assigned to the
most energy-hungry enterprises according to the choices of other sovereign
nations. This generates a number of
questions: From whom will these further free quotas be subtracted? Or are
they to delay the reduction objectives?
Which energy-hungry enterprises will
receive them—and in which industries?
The definition of “certainty,” so
much in vogue in Brussels, apparently includes as a variable the political
choices of an undefined number of foreign countries over the next 12 years.

The lesser evil
If one must choose between two
unnecessary evils, it is wiser to pick the
lesser one. Thinking about the costs of
climate strategies means thinking about
their benefits as well, and therefore
the opportunity of imposing binding
domestic targets.
This is particularly important in light
of the substantial scientific uncertainties that remain concerning the global
warming phenomenon and on the high
probability that the benefit question
will remain politically isolated in the
short term in the effort to reduce emissions.
From this stems the substantial
practical uselessness of the European
policies, even if they were justified,
effective, and efficient, because Europe
represents an important but nevertheless minor and relatively decreasing
fraction of global emissions.
Strictly connected to these questions
is the issue of the political feasibility of climate policies. There is virtual
unanimity among experts that from
the political point of view, a cap and
trade system is easier to launch than
a carbon tax—the direct alternative
to cap and trade—as the tax regulates

prices instead of emission quantities. The European
story provides evidence of that. However, the price of
having a cap and trade system—the option with less
political resistance—is having a system that is volatile,
opaque, and arbitrary.
A carbon tax, on the other hand, at least can provide a more predictable environment to businesses
while creating fewer occasions for rent-seeking or
corruption, because the degree of political arbitrariness is lower with a carbon tax. From a certain point
of view, therefore, the option with less political desirability due to the difficulty of garnering consensus
on a tax and the need to substantially reformulate
the fiscal system actually has an advantage over cap
and trade. This is because the politically less-feasible
option guarantees that the measure will be taken
only when a truly large portion of the population is
willing to pay more to obtain a certain environmental
goal.
For the same reason, it will be easier to abrogate
the tax—a move politically less difficult than cancelling regulations as encrusted with lobby activities
as they are obscure to most people—when and if it
becomes evident that the European strategy is not
sustainable or that global warming is a problem less
severe than what is believed today.
Before following the European example, the next
US president might want to further examine this state
of affairs, visit Europe, and personally see that a failing
policy in Europe can hardly lead to a healthy one in
America. ✦

hen the US Senate Energy and
Natural Resources Committee sent 45 public land, forest, park,
and water bills to the floor on May 7,
the measures included closure of 1.2
million federal acres in Wyoming to
future oil and gas leasing.
“Natural gas prices are up 48%
over this time last year, and consumers could pay as much as $85.9 billion more for gas in 2008 vs. 2007,”
said Paul N. Cicio, president of the
Industrial Energy Consumers of
America. “At a time when every homeowner, farmer, and manufacturer
is suffering from high energy costs,
this is not the time for Congress to

the Cowboy State’s two US senators, Republicans John Barrasso and
Mike Enzi; its governor, Democrat
Dave Freudenthal; and many others
because it involves a mountain range
that is 100 miles long, 12,000 ft
high, and named for the state.
It also is a bill that Barrasso’s
predecessor, Craig L. Thomas, was
spearheading before he died on June
4, 2007. “This legislation, [which]
Craig Thomas was ready to introduce

Barrasso said that S. 2229 respects
current leaseholders’ property rights
in the Wyoming Range and BridgerTeton National Forest by allowing
other parties, presumably conservation groups, to buy the leases and
retire them. It does not prevent future
production from current leases.
About 4,300 producing oil and
gas wells in the three counties covered by the legislation and 4,399
proposed wells would not be affected, Barrasso added.

Senate, House approve
bills to suspend SPR
crude oil purchases
The US Senate and House overwhelmingly approved bills on May 13
to suspend crude oil purchases for the
Strategic Petroleum Reserve through the
end of 2008 unless prices fall below
$75/bbl for 90 days.
It was not clear what would happen
next since the bills might need to be
reconciled in a joint conference. But
the margins of approval (97 votes to 1
in the Senate, 385 to 25 in the House)
showed that there was more than
enough support to override an anticipated presidential veto.
Discussion in both chambers emphasized that each measure was a small, but
immediate, effort to reduce exceptionally high crude oil prices. “When the
American consumer is being burned at
the stake, his government should not be
carrying wood for the fire,” said Byron
L. Dorgan (D-ND), who introduced the
Senate bill on Feb. 6.
Republicans in the House and Senate

Wildlife Refuge’s (ANWR’s) coastal

of the House bill that Rep. Peter Welch

But Rep. Joe Barton (R-Tex.), the
Energy and Commerce Committee’s
ranking minority member, led opposition to the measure not so much
because he disagreed with its concept
but because it came to the floor without
going through a hearing and markup in
the committee and that it arrived under

Barton said that he also thought

“There is plenty of blame to go

refiners also worked to increase production at installations that had not been

County Mayo they’re still arguing
over the route of the pipeline Shell
E&P Ireland wants to construct from
offshore Corrib gas field (OGJ, Nov.
20, 2006, p. 30).
Shell E&P Ireland has applied for
direct planning permission to build
a rerouted pipeline for the Corrib
gas project in north Mayo. But Shell’s
application has stirred bitter opposition from some sections of the local
community.
According to local reports, Shell
has sought planning permission
for the construction of a 92.6 km
gas pipeline, of which 9.2 km will
be onshore. The gas field is 3,500
m below sea level. This follows a
12-month public consultation process, which led to a new route being
proposed.
The original route was designed
in 2000. The application was made
directly to An Bord Pleanala, or
National Planning Board, as the
project is thought to involve strategic infrastructure. That means Shell

OTC: Natural gas
hydrates research
active, promising
Methane hydrates research has made
unexpected strides since 2000, but
technical and economic obstacles have
to be resolved before hydrates production can be proved feasible, a speaker
told the Offshore Technology Conference in Houston on May 8.
Brad Tomer, director for the Strategic
Center for Natural Gas and Oil within
the US Department of Energy, credited
recent successful research to what he
called “aggressive” international collaboration research and development
efforts.
“We haven’t done long-term productivity tests yet,” Tomer said during his
luncheon speech. “This is very young
research and development...we’ve got
a lot to learn.” Hydrates also were
discussed at separate technical sessions
at OTC.
The US Geological Survey’s Energy
Resources Program has said the world’s
gas hydrates accumulations exceed the
volume of known conventional gas
resources.
Tomer said the question remains as
to whether industry can economically
produce those resources. It’s estimated
the US gas hydrates resources could total 200,000 tcf of gas in place and that
world hydrates resources could total
about 700,000 tcf of gas in place.
Tomer said he is optimistic that hydrates production can be demonstrated
on a commercial scale by 2020, and
that commercial production possibility
could get under way by 2025.
Japan might have the most active
hydrates research program, Tomer said,
adding that other countries with research programs are India, China, South
Korea, Canada, and the US. ✦

COMPANY NEWS

EnCana plans split into separate oil, gas companies
The board of Canadian oil and natural gas company EnCana Corp. has approved a proposal to split along distinct
business lines—oil and gas—to create
two Calgary-based energy firms.
In other recent company news:
• In what could be the biggest
takeover in Australian resources history,
UK-based BG Group has made a $13
billion (Aus.) bid for major oil, gas,
and electric power group Origin Energy
Ltd., Sydney.
• Perth-based Arc Energy Ltd. is
to merge with Australian Worldwide
Exploration, Sydney, to form an entity
with a market capitalization exceeding
$2 billion (Aus). The new company
will have a portfolio of interests on and
offshore holding proved and probable
reserves of more than 78 million boe.
• Stone Energy Corp. will acquire
and then merge with Bois d’Arc Energy
Inc. of Houston, in a cash and stock
deal valued at $1.65 billion, the Lafayette, La.-based independent reported.
Including debt, the companies value the
deal at $1.8 billion.
• Total SA will pay $480 million
(Can.) for Synenco Energy Inc. to acquire a 60% stake in and operatorship
of the Northern Lights Canadian heavy
oil project in Alberta’s Athabasca region.

EnCana forms IOCo, GasCo
EnCana’s split will create a publicly
traded, fully integrated oil company,
with a working name of IntegratedOilCo
(IOCo), which will focus on EnCana’s
Canadian oil sands assets and refinery interests in the US, underpinned by an established gas and oil production base in
Alberta and Saskatchewan, the company
said. IOCo assets, which will encompass
EnCana’s Integrated Oil Division and Canadian Plains Division, represent about
one third of EnCana’s current production and proved reserves. The permanent
name of IOCo will be determined before

the transaction closes.
The other company, with a working name of GasCo, will encompass
EnCana’s Canadian Foothills Division,
USA Division, Offshore and International Division, and midstream assets

“to form a pure-play gas company
aimed at growing existing high-potential resource plays in Canada and
the US,” the company said. GasCo will
represent about two thirds of EnCana’s
current production and proved reserves.

It is expected that GasCo will retain the
EnCana Corp. moniker.
“This transaction is designed to
enhance long-term value for EnCana
shareholders by creating two highly sustainable, independent entities, each with
an ability to pursue and achieve greater
success by employing operational strategies best suited to its unique assets and
business plans,” the company said.
EnCana shareholders are to receive
one share in each of IOCo and GasCo
for each share of EnCana held. The split
is expected to be completed in early
2009.

IOCo’s assets
IOCo’s asset base will include EnCana’s two producing upstream Alberta
oil sands areas—Foster Creek and Christina Lake—and two refineries at Wood
River, Ill., and Borger, Tex.
Upstream, construction is under way
to increase production capacity more than
200% to an estimated average of about
110,000 net b/d of oil by 2012. Current
production is about 30,000 net b/d.
In October 2006, EnCana announced
it had entered into an agreement with
ConocoPhillips to create an integrated
oil business. At that time, independently
determined best estimates of recoverable bitumen for Foster Creek and
Christina Lake were disclosed at more
than 6.5 billion bbl and more than 2.5
billion bbl for Borealis, which is not
part of the joint venture with ConocoPhillips.
“As a result of today’s announcement, the greater focus on the in-situ
oil sands assets of IOCo and given
that IOCo will have all of its upstream
operations in Western Canada, it is anticipated that EnCana will be reviewing
the need to report the in-situ resources
and other assets to be held by IOCo under the standards required by Canadian
securities regulatory authorities,” the
company said.
“Over the next decade, IOCo’s target
as part of the integrated oil sands joint
venture with ConocoPhillips is to increase gross upstream bitumen production from Foster Creek and Christina

previous closing price of $10.47/share.
The offer values the Australian integrated energy entity at just under $13
billion. Just prior to the bid, Origin had
a market capitalization of $9.2 billion.
Origin acknowledged the bid, but
said further discussions must take place
that may or may not lead to an agreed
transaction. The bid also is subject to
approvals from shareholders, Australia’s

Through the years, many geochemical methods have been developed for
the detection of near surface hydrocarbon seepage anomalies. The methods
most often used require the capture and
analysis of gas phase hydrocarbons. This
has proven to be difficult and expensive,
requiring the use of special drilling rigs
and sample containers.
Other methods, usually termed as indirect, have the ability to detect hydrocarbons but are less frequently used due
to the incorrect assumption they do not
directly detect seepage anomalies.
Methods are now available that
directly detect hydrocarbons but do not
require gas capture or special sampling
tools.

The intensity of the spectrum is greatest in the ultraviolet range and decreases toward the visible light range. Unless the solution has color, little curve detail is expected above 350 nanometers.
UV-Vis spectroscopy measures a myriad of saturated, unsaturated, and ring-shaped hydrocarbons in solution that are represented by an absorbance value at each wavelength.

UV alternative
Ultraviolet-Visible light spectroscopy
offers an alternative to gas chromatograpy.
A UV-Vis spectrophotometer
measures the intensity of light passing through a sample and compares it
to the intensity of the light before it
passed through the sample. The ratio
of the before and after measurements
is called transmittance and is usually
expressed as a percentage (%T). Absorbance, A, is based on the transmittance
using the relationship A = –log(%T).
Samples for UV-Vis spectroscopy are
most often liquids placed in a transparent cell known as a cuvette. Cuvettes are
typically rectangular in shape, commonly with an internal width of 1 cm
(Fig. 2).
UV-Vis spectroscopy measures
hydrocarbons that are soluble in water
without the need to measure associated
gases. Rather than measure hydrocarbon
gas in parts per million (ppm) or parts
per billion (ppb), UV-Vis spectroscopy
measures the soluble hydrocarbon concentration in absorbance units.
Absorbance is directly proportional
to the path length (cell width) and the
concentration of the absorbing chemical species. The resulting peak height, or
intensity, is analogous to concentration.
Also, different molecules absorb radiation of different wavelengths.

THE REMAINDER

September 30 – October 2, 2008
Hilton Fort Worth
Fort Worth, Texas USA

UNCONVENTIONAL GAS EXTRACTION BECOMING VIABLE
Production from unconventional reservoirs — tight gas sands, shales, and coalbeds--accounts for a large and growing share of total gas
supply. But the reservoirs are complex. The costs of drilling into and completing wells in them are continually rising while presenting unique
environmental problems. Producing gas from unconventional reserves proﬁtably, safely, and in amounts demanded by the market requires
increasingly sophisticated recovery methods.
Gas recovery from unconventional reserves will be explored on September 30 – October 2, 2008 at the
Unconventional Gas International Conference & Exhibition to be held at the Hilton Fort Worth, in Fort Worth,
Texas. Planned by the editors of Oil & Gas Journal and an Advisory Board of industry experts, the event will
highlight innovation from unconventional gas plays around the world.

The basin has produced more than
940 million bbl of oil.

Brazil
Petroleo Brasileiro SA (Petrobras)
and partners are evaluating the possibility of using a different rig to complete
drilling an exploration well on the
Serpa subsalt prospect on Block 24 in
the Espirito Santo basin off Brazil.
The well has not yet reached its
primary objective or its projected total
depth of 19,500 ft, but the partnership
was “encouraged by evidence of an
active petroleum system in the subsalt
section encountered in the well,” said
30% partner Anadarko Petroleum Corp.
Petrobras is operator with 40%
working interest, and EnCana Brazil
Ltda. has 30%.

Georgia
Frontera Resources Corp., Houston,
said it appears to have established sustainable oil production with no associated flow of sediment at its Dino-2 well
in the Taribani field unit in Block 12 in
eastern Georgia’s Kura basin (see map,
OGJ, Nov. 26, 2007, p. 32).
Zone 9, a 10-m reservoir at 2,300
m, has produced at rates as high as 150
b/d of 36° gravity oil on a 4⁄64-in. choke
with 1,500 psi surface pressure drawdown from bottomhole pressure of
5,900 psi after frac.
The well will remain on test for
20-60 days, and the workover rig and
frac equipment are moving to the T-45
location for a frac pac completion attempt in Zone 9 at 2,400 m.

Montana
Bill Barrett Corp., Denver, plans to
start a program in the second quarter
of 2008 to drill as many as four vertical
wells to Cretaceous Cody shale in the
overthrust southeast of Helena, Mont.
The company tested gas flows from
Cody shale at the Draco and Leviathan wells in the area, but production

commercial quantities of gas to support
pipeline construction. The company has
a 50% operated working interest in the
Circus and Toston-Six Mile areas, where
it had amassed 162,000 acres by the
end of 2007.

North Dakota
Continental Resources Inc., Enid,
Okla., initiated a frac job in the Three
Forks/Sanish formation in early May on
the Bice 1-29H well in Dunn County,
ND.
In this part of the Williston basin
Nesson anticline, the Lower Bakken
shale underlies the widely exploited
Middle Bakken shale and overlies the
little explored Three Forks/Sanish.
“Continental is testing the theory
that the Three Forks/Sanish zone is not
being drained by wells that have been
drilled in the Middle Bakken horizontal
lateral, and, therefore, that the Three
Forks/Sanish may hold significant
additional reserve potential under the
company’s acreage,” the company said.

Oregon
US Geothermal Inc., Boise, Idaho,
has spud the first full-size geothermal
well at its Neal Hot Springs project in
northern Malheur County, eastern Oregon, 90 miles northwest of Boise.
The NHS-1 well is permitted to
3,500 ft at a spot near a 1979 discovery
well drilled by Chevron Minerals. US
Geothermal expects 30 days of drilling
and 60 days of flow and reservoir tests.
The company has leased 9.6 sq
miles in the area where a suite of wells
drilled by Chevron identified a commercial geothermal resource at 2,820
ft. Consultants reported likely reservoir
temperatures of 311-320° F. Gravity
and magnetic data were used to identify
drilling locations.
The development plan anticipates 26
Mw of power production.

Tennessee
Logs from a well in Morgan County,

Tenn., appear to show 17 ft of net pay
in the Cambrian Rome formation,
which has never produced in Tennessee,
said Montello Resources Ltd., Calgary.
The John Bowen-2 well log showed
the potential gas zone at 8,275 ft. A
completion attempt is planned. The well
site is 1 mile from a gas pipeline.

Utah
Delta Petroleum Corp., Denver, said
its Federal 28-11 well in 28-22s-17e,
Grand County, Utah, is averaging 200
b/d of oil and 600 Mcfd of gas from
the O and P intervals of Pennsylvanian
age in the northwestern Paradox basin.
Meanwhile, the company reached
total depth in the quarter ended
Mar. 31 at the Federal 31-36, Federal
26-43D, and Federal 36-24H wells, all
in its Greentown project area in Grand
County. It plans to drill laterals as long
as several thousand feet at these wells
in both the Pennsylvanian Cane Creek
shale and shallower O interval.
The company’s Greentown gas pipeline is expected to be in service by the
end of June.
Delta plans to drill later this year at
its Cocklebur Draw prospect in Southwest Colorado to different geologic
intervals than those at Greentown.

Washington
Delta Petroleum Corp., Denver, is
moving a rig to the Columbia River
basin to spud the Gray 31-23 wildcat
on its 100% owned Bronco prospect in
Klickitat County, Wash. (OGJ, Jan. 14,
2008, p. 35).
Delta expects the well to emerge
from basalt at 8,000 ft and to be one
of the basin’s only wells to penetrate
the entire Eocene Roslyn formation,
which it reckons will be 4,500 ft thick.
Projected total depth is 15,000 ft.
The well, to be drilled with or
without third-party participation, is
expected to spud during May 2008.
The company said it continues to be in
discussion with several industry companies regarding participation.

Researchers at China
University of Petroleum
have developed new
drilling and completion
fluids to minimize damage in Jurassic sandDrilling
stones.
This work addresses
the characteristics of geological structure, lithology, permeability, porosity,
and mineral components of a typical
high-pressure, low-permeability, dense
reservoir formation in China’s Tarim oil
field.
The main types of damage in these
low-permeability formations are waterblocking and stress sensibility.
Numerous studies have shown that
the extent of water-blocking damage
ranges from 70% to 90%,1-5 and stresssensitivity damage ranges from 25% to
60%.6
In a laboratory setting, China University of Petroleum developed new
low-permeability drilling and completion fluids composed mainly of highly
effective surfactants, temporary plugging agents, various types of bridging
agents, and polyether glycol.
Both laboratory evaluation experiments and field tests have shown that
the new low-permeability KCl sulfonated polymer drilling fluids are suitable
for high-pressure exploratory wells. The
permeability ratios (Ks′/KS) of cores
from a test well drastically increased
after use of the new drilling fluids.
In addition, the new, low-damage
drilling fluids have many other advantages such as good rheological properties, high temporary plugging effect,
and low filtration.
This article introduces characteristics of damage for low-permeability,
high-pressure, tight sandstone reservoirs in Tarim oil field and presents the
approaches to prevent damage during
drilling and completion operations.

to invasive fluids, high capillary pressure, water-blocking, anisotropic target
formation, and high flow resistance.
They have lots of natural microfractures,
leading to stress sensitivity.
Water sensitivity and water-blocking
are caused by invasive fluids and are
major causes of damage. Stress sensitivity caused by the alteration of effective
stress, which equates to the overburden
pressure minus
formation pressure, is the other
main damaging
factor.
Once damaged, formation

can rarely be recovered.

New ﬂuids prevent formation
damage to Tarim sandstones

Geological characteristics
Jurassic formations in Tarim oil field
occur 4,534.5 to 4,968 m deep in
high, steep structures. The Jurassic section includes tight sandstone and coal
intervals. Main mineral types are quartz
(46%), rock cuttings (46%), a bit of
feldspar (6%), and mud minerals (7%).
Porosity is filled mainly with clay,
calcium, and carbon substances. The
clay minerals include illite, chlorite, and
occasionally smectite and kaolinite.
Cores taken from the Jurassic target
formation show that main types of
porosity are dissolved pores between
particles, some pores within particles,
and microfractures.
The pressure coefficient of the target
formation is 1.25 to 1.87; temperature
is 120º C.; effective porosity ranges

from 0.3% to 14.4% (average 5%);
permeability ranges from 0.01 × 10–3
sq μm to 380 × 10–3 sq μm.
In short, the target formation can
be distinguished as a low-permeability,
high-temperature, high-pressure reservoir with microporosity.

Potential damage

and origins of water-blocking.
Water-blocking or filtrate-blocking
is one of the most damaging mechanisms in low-permeability formations, especially in low-permeability
gas reservoirs. When drops of invasive
fluids move into small micropore
throats, deformation will occur at the
oil-liquid interface, and the extent of
deformability is different in two ends
(r1, r2 is curvature radius of two ends,
respectively).
Capillary pressure ΔP is expressed

We analyzed cores taken from the
target formation in Well YN2 (depth
4,543.8 to 4,552 m).

with the following equation:7
Δρ = 2σ (1/r1–1/r2)
Such additional resistance is the socalled “water-blocking effect” because
of the stacking of water-blocking. While
a string fluid drop coexists in a same
capillary, flow resistance of oil or gas
phase in target formation will greatly
increase and permeability of the oil-gas
phase remarkably decrease.
Generally speaking, water-blocking is
notable when the diameter of formation
pore throat is less than 10 μm.
The experimental results of pressing
Hg in and out of core samples taken
from the Jurassic target formation reveal
that the diameters of pore throats in
target formation range from 0.01 to
9.0 μm. Consequently water-blocking
damage caused by capillary effect cannot be ignored.
Apart from some abnormal highpressure spheres, the pressure coefficient of drilling fluids is larger than
that of the target formation and can
reach 1.90 g/cc. If there is insufficient
shielding, packing, framing, and filling
particles, large quantities of filtrate can
invade the formation.
It can be seen from water-blocking
damage experiments of low-permeability cores taken from the Jurassic
target formation that the maximal
damaging extent of permeability was
41.5% (Fig. 1). Along with reduction
in core permeability, Ka, original water
saturation, Swi, and increase in oil-water interfacial tension, σo-a, the damaging extent Rs of water-blocking shows
an upward trend (Fig. 2).
Because of well depth, high pressures, and drilling interruptions, the
drilling period and duration of time
that drilling fluids were soaking into the formation were

prolonged; hence the amount
of invasive fluids increased.

damage to formations with low permeability and micropore throats.

Fluid study
Based on current drilling technology
and known damage factors in Jurassic formations with low-permeability,
guidelines to develop new drilling
fluids include:
1. Selecting effective surfactants to
minimize filtration and water-blocking.
2. Selecting compound temporary
shielding or packing agents mixed with
framing, filling, and deforming particles
to form thinner and tighter mud cake
on borehole wall. The formed mud cake
should have a good toughness, high
strength, and drainage rate to protect
formation from stress damage and longterm exposure to drilling fluids.
3. Optimizing various treating
agents to avoid damage caused by
macromolecule polymer agents pressed
into formation along with drilling fluid
filtrate.
It is also necessary to optimize fluids
to prevent formation collapse by inhibiting sloughing and staying within a
safe density window.

Selecting surfactants
Lab experiments tested many surfactants commonly used to minimize surface tension (Table 1). These included:
• Alkyl benzene sulfonate (ABS).
• Alkyl phenol alkoxylate, nonionic
(OP-10).
• Sodium oleate.

particles for Jurassic formations. To the
QCX-1, we added deforming particles
such as FB-2 (particle-size distribution
of 0.04 to 75 μm; median particle size
12.0 μm), and asphalt base materials
FT-1, AL, and YL-80 to reinforce effect
of temporary shielding and plugging,
and low filtration.

Temporary plugging

Rheology, inhibition,
compatibility

Temporary plugging agents in
drilling fluids can quickly form thin,
strong, tough mud cake that can prevent
small particles and filtrate from deeply
invading formations. Ideally, temporary
plugging agents should be easy to drain
out afterwards. High-quality drilling
fluids with good temporary plugging
characteristics can be designed by
compounding framing and deforming
particles, etc.
On the basis of size distribution of
pore throats of target formation with
low-permeability in Jurassic system and
size distribution of present temporary
plugging agent particles such as QCX-1,
QS-2, etc. (Figs. 3-4).
After numerous experimental tests,
we chose QCX-1 as the optimal plugging agent with compatible framing

• HTHP filtration, 8.0 ml.
• pH value, 9.0.
The experimental results show that
rheological properties, filtration, and
temporary plugging effect of the new
fluids meet the requirements for use in
the target formation. The primary and
secondary recoveries of rock cuttings
were 96.6% and 72.3%, respectively
(Fig. 5). The new, low-permeability
drilling fluids are good inhibitors and
are compatible with formation rock.
Also, mixing drilling fluid with in situ
fluids in 1:1 proportion resulted in no
obvious abnormal phenomena.

Permeability recovery
The test conditions of core samples
included a confining pressure of 4 MPa
and a flow rate of 1.0 ml/min. The
initial permeability, KS, of core samples
taken from the Jurassic target formation was measured by displacing with
neutral kerosine.
Next, lab personnel reversely contaminated the cores with drilling fluids
for 4 hr then removed them from the
fluids, removed the mud cake, reversed
core direction, displaced with neutral
kerosine, measured permeability KS′ of
contaminated cores, and calculated the
permeability recovery Ks′/KS of contaminated cores.
Table 2 data show that the permeability recovery of cores contaminated
with new, low-damage drilling fluids
increased 27.2% (with added surfactant
and temporary plugging agents).

New ﬂuid effectiveness
The new KCl-sulfonated polymer
drilling fluids were first field tested
in the Jurassic section of preliminary
prospecting well YN4 (depth 3,641
m) in Tarim oil field. Table 3 shows the
rheological properties and permeability
recovery of wellsite drilling fluids taken
from well YN4.
We tested Core No. 1 (Table 4) with
high-concentration agents such as
KCl, FT-1, AL, FB-2, and YL-80 (abledeforming agents). The rheological
properties and filtration performance
were acceptable; API filtration was 1.0
ml, and HTHP filtration was 2.0 ml.
The formed mud cake was thin,
dense, and tough, reflecting that
particle-size distribution of various
kinds of treating agents was reasonable,
and relatively low filtration was good
enough to protect the formation.
The second drilling fluid system
(Table 3) was added to 2% QCX-1 +
3% FB-2 + 0.2% ABSN + 3% EP-553
(polybasic alcohol). The results show
that viscosity and shearing force of the
drilling fluids increased a bit, while the
rest of the parameters changed little.
As shown in Table 4, permeability
recovery (Ks′/KS) was more than 85%,
indicating that the second drilling fluid
can protect formation from damaging.
Field tests with the new, low-damage
drilling fluids in Jurassic formations
show that drilling trips were successful
and drilling rates were quick, with low
frictional resistance and no borehole

these field tests, we draw the following
conclusions:
• Water-blocking and stress sensibility are two main damaging types of lowpermeability tight sandstone reservoir.
Experimental results of target formation
core samples show that the damaging
extent of water-blocking could reach
41.5%.
• The main factors influencing
water-blocking include permeability,
porosity, initial water saturation (gap
between irreducible water saturation
and original water saturation), and oilwater interfacial tension. Other influencing factors include lithology, types
of formation cement, pore structure,
properties of invasive fluids, etc.
• The new, low-damage, broad
spectrum KCl/sulfur polymer drilling
and completion fluids appear to prevent
water-blocking, are effective plugging
agents, prevent collapse, and have high
permeability recovery. The new fluid
provided effective formation protection
and stabilized the wellbores. ✦

To operate a world-class maintenance
organization, plant operators need
precise information combined with
the ability to act quickly in response to
impending emergencies. A computerized maintenance management system
(CMMS) can help refiners eliminate the
vast majority of unscheduled equipment repairs.
This article discusses the features of a
CMMS that are important for plant owners
to demand.
The main objective of maintenance
management is to
achieve the optimum
balance between plant
availability and maintenance resource
use. The effective matching of labor
and material resources for maintenance
planning and control is a dynamic
activity.
Plant management needs reliable
information of both equipment performance and costs, which will allow them
to make informed decisions. It is therefore essential to adapt to techniques that

the unforeseen plant outages.
Implementation of a computerized
maintenance system is an effective
way to achieve this goal. Selection and
proper implementation of the correct
CMMS is an integral part of achieving
maintenance management success.

CMMS

The maintenance department should:
• Provide effective maintenance
services that support facility operational
requirements.
• Reduce unscheduled equipment
downtime through effective maintenance planning.
• Use the CMMS report generator
to provide meaningful management
reports that will increase the control of
maintenance activities.
• Use CMMS to ensure that maintenance is performed efficiently through
organized planning and the coordinated
use of materials, manpower, and time.
• Create and maintain measurements
of maintenance performance within
CMMS.
One of the highest priorities of a
maintenance manager
should be keeping the
equipment operating (rePECIAL

goal is to reduce downttime by some percentage.

streamlining the maintenance process
by allowing maintenance personnel to
respond to early warning signals before
they escalate into critical repair problems.
A CMMS builds on these types of
interfaces to automatically create work
orders and update equipment histories
based on alarms and test results received through these interfaces.
5. RCM integration. The CMMS system
should fully integrate and take advantage of RCM.
In selecting a CMMS, the operator
should conduct a formal review to determine the key performance indicators
(KPIs). Then the operator must consider
where the data to produce these KPIs is
going to come from.
Frequently these KPIs will require
data from different systems; for example, maintenance cost/tonne may require data from the CMMS or accounting system and the production systems.
Maintenance safety statistics may need
data from a totally separate system.
Reliability and maintainability indicators should look better in a
CMMS. The mean time between failures
(MTBF) should increase and the mean
time to repair (MTTR), if managed correctly, should stay at the pre-implementation low level.
A maintenance workforce in a reactive state will have a very low MTBF of
equipment and an equally low MTTR.
This may be masked, if not measured
and regularly reported, by the fact that
machine availability may still be at a
high level.
What the indicator shows is that a
plant or piece of machinery is unreliable and breaks down often; and that
workers are good at fixing these breakdowns. The culture that is fostered in
these situations can be the most difficult
obstacle in the implementation of a
CMMS and realizing its possible gains.

Machine availability
With the amount of day-to-day data
available in a CMMS that pinpoints
problem areas and modifies processes
and routines, other factors are easier to

achieve. A reduction in the amount of
breakdown work, or increase in overall
availability of plant and equipment, of
5% is a realistic and achievable goal.

Ideally, the plant operator should
integrate the CMMS with a predictive
maintenance system. At a minimum, the
predictive maintenance system should
accurately monitor real-time equipment
performance and alert the maintenance
professional to any changes in performance trends.
There are many measurements that a
predictive maintenance package could
track including vibration, oil condition,
temperature, flow, etc. CMMS is a great
organizational tool but can not directly
monitor equipment condition.
A predictive maintenance system
excels in monitoring equipment condition. It is ideal to combine the two
technologies into a seamless system
that avoids catastrophic breakdowns but
eliminates needless repairs to equipment that is running satisfactory. ✦

SUBSEA TIEBACK FORUM & EXHIBITION

THE DEEPEST SHOW ON EARTH
March 3 - 5, 2009
Henry B. Gonzales Convention Center | San Antonio, TX

SUBSEA TIEBACK
FORUM & EXHIBITION

PennWell invites you to the 9th annual Subsea Tieback Forum & Exhibition. SSTB has become the premier
event for one of the fastest growing field development segments. This year’s SSTB is scheduled for March
3 – 5, 2009 in San Antonio, TX at the Henry B. Gonzales Convention Center. Over 2,000 people and 150
exhibitors are expected at this year’s conference. You can’t afford to miss it.
This year’s theme is “The Deepest Show On Earth.” As our industry changes, the sharing of knowledge and
collective experiences becomes more and more crucial to improving the quality, safety, and economics of the
subsea tieback industry.
The conference board will once again solicit a number of key presentations by industry leaders. As in the
past, only by participating in this conference will you be able to receive its benefits, as proceedings will
not be published and no Press is ever allowed in the conference area. This is truly a closed forum with
open discussion, where the information shared inside the conference room stays inside the conference
room. We hope you will join us.

inlet isolation valve is a stagnant piece
of pipe. During the regeneration cycle,
this pipe and its contents have the potential to cool to dewpoint temperature
pending the gas composition, which
is a problem if the temperature of the
wet gas entering the dehydration unit is
above atmospheric.
As the vapor cools, water and hydrocarbons can condense and remain
in the stagnant leg. When the regeneration cycle (heating and cooling) is
over and the inlet isolation valve opens,
these liquids are forced into the top of
the molecular sieve bed with the inlet
gas. This mechanism and the damage
it causes are repeated as it recurs with
every regeneration cycle.
To solve inlet piping traps, various
piping arrangements can be made for
new or old installations. Fig. 3b describes a drain system installed at one
facility to remove the stagnant liquids
that had pooled.

As with hydrocarbon condensation
from wet inlet-gas piping, both hydrocarbon and water vapor condensing in
the regeneration-gas piping can occur
with poor piping design.
During the regeneration cycle, warm
to hot, water and hydrocarbon-saturated gas leaves the top of the molecular
sieve bed. This stream immediately
cools upon contact with the regeneration-gas outlet piping. Hydrocarbon
and water condensing ensues.
When the bed goes from cooling
to adsorption, the inlet isolation valve
opens and the pooled liquid flows to
the top of the molecular sieve bed. Fig.
4a describes a commonly installed liquid trap in regeneration-gas piping.
Since this is a piping design flaw,
numerous solutions are available. Fig. 4b

causes of problems in gas processing in
general and molecular sieve dehydration specifically.
As a rule, the bigger the separator,
the better the bulk separation of vapor
and liquid. A large separator with a
demister pad upstream of molecular
sieve dehydrators, however, does not
guarantee sufficient vapor-liquid separation. This is because there will always be
some liquid carryover, be it sub-μ-size
mist or slugs of liquid.
Bulk separation followed by coalescer-type filters on gas streams upstream
of molecular sieves (and on regeneration-gas streams from reciprocating

compressors) is essential for keeping
liquid hydrocarbons and free water out
of the molecular sieve. Both separation
devices require redundant level indication to minimize the possibility of
carryover.
In the case of retrograde condensation, however, good separation upstream of dehydration will not prevent
hydrocarbon liquids from forming and
damaging the mole sieve.

genic process exceeds NGL specifications for allowable methanol in the

Methanol

Mechanical damage

Methanol injection in gas gathering pipelines is a common method to
inhibit hydrate formation. Methanol
adsorbs considerably more on 4A sieve
than 3A. Replacing 4A sieve with 3A
was part of a success story at one BP
facility. Before changing to 3A sieve,
NGL tariff limits should be researched
to determine whether methanol passing through the sieve into the cryo-

The support screens on which the
molecular sieve sits tend to be made

dehydrator vessels generally consist of
2.5+ in. thick carbon steel. When hot

flows into the vessel, the stainless-steel

expansion and corresponding increase
in diameter.
The carbon steel vessel ID is virtually

unchanged, on the other hand, because
there is more mass and less relative
surface area for heat transfer and thermal expansion of carbon steel wall is
less than stainless steel. Hence the rope
packing between the support screen
and the vessel becomes compressed.
As the regeneration continues, the
vessel wall warms, and the ID grows
when cooling gas is applied, the
thermal cycle is reversed. That is, the
support screen shrinks quickly and the
vessel ID slowly decreases. In largediameter molecular sieve vessels, the
difference in metal growth and shrinkage between the support screen and the
vessel becomes significant.
Specifically, molecular sieve dust and
extrudate or spheres tend to fall into the
rope packing. After numerous regeneration cycles, the rope packing begins to
lose its elasticity due to the solid material. The support screen then loses the
ability fully to expand and the longer
screens tend to buckle.
Buckling has ranged from minor
(with no operational problems) to
major (in which the molecular sieve
fell into the cavity beneath the support
screen). In the latter, pressure drop
across the bed increased and channeling
(on both adsorption and regeneration)
was exacerbated. Operators’ response
may be to increase regeneration temperature and reduce cycle times, worsening the problem.
If the system lacks appropriate
instrumentation or is not monitored,
the support screen problem may not be
identified until the vessel is opened for
the molecular sieve replacement. Replacing or repairing the screens can add
weeks to the molecular sieve changeout
time (which reduces plant availability).
Proper instrumentation and daily monitoring of regeneration and dust-filter
pressure drop help identify a problem
and prepare adequate plans before vessel entry.
Where the bed had collapsed
through the screen, there were several
mechanisms used to resolve the issue.

pipelines through shallow inshore waters and across the only shipping channel to the port of Mina Salman.

Background
Bapco began expanding the Khuff
gas transmission and distribution
networks in Bahrain in 1996, seeking
to increase gas delivery to meet rising
demand for natural gas for power generation and other local industries.
Offshore pipelines emerged as an
option to provide gas to a new power
station in the Hidd area and to customers encouraged to participate in
Bahrain’s development. These projects
included both the increase in electricity
and desalinated water supply and development of the Hidd Industrial Area and
Sheikh Khalifa bin Salman deepwater
port.
Other options for gas transport
included laying pipelines from near the
Sitra power station or across the newly
built Sheikh Khalifa causeway and
bridge.
Consultation with government
bodies and engineering companies
prompted the decision to lay three parallel pipelines across the channel from
a point near Bapco’s Sitra tank farm and

transmission pipeline links would be
required to improve flow rates and
maintain delivery pressures to the
distribution system. This review determined an additional five gas transmission pipelines, running parallel to
existing pipelines, would be required

Offshore detail
The pipeline system needed to deliver 475 MMcfd at no less than 500 psig.
Plans considered the sensitive location,
maintenance, and security of supply.
The decision to install three pipelines
provided 100% redundancy.
The location of the pipelines and
proposed future development in the
area highlighted the need to use ASME
B31.8 Location Class 3 and 4 design
criteria, supplemented by Det Norske
Veritas requirements for offshore submarine pipelines.
Theses codes classified the first
4,000 m of pipeline, located near the
Sitra Marine terminal and Sitra Island,
as Location Class 4 and the remaining
section running across QAQ Island to
the Hidd metering station as Location
Class 3. The design required the pipe be This illustration shows Bapco’s advance plans for crossing the 10-in. gas line on QAQ Island supplying

and 12.4 mm. Pipe consisted of API 5L
Gr. X52 PSL2, coated with a three-layer
polyethylene system.
Design of the pipeline required a
concrete weight coating to overcome
buoyancy factors and provide mechanical protection. Installation at an invert
depth of 3 m required extensive trenching with a dredger in the deepwater
channel and tracked machinery in the
shallow-water areas.

Offshore needs
The coastal marine environment
of Bahrain is important to the local
people. They have been fishing in both
the shallow and deep waters of the
area for generations. Bapco sought to
protect this marine environment during front-end engineering and design
and conducted environmental impact
studies. Shallow-water fish traps needed
to be moved for trenching and pipelay,
and local fishermen had to be considered and alternative locations for traps
provided.
QAQ Island was also home to
migrating terns. Bapco considered
the effect of installation work on the

island habitats to their original state on
completion of the project.

be crossed on the south side of QAQ
Island. Maintenance of gas supply to
this customer was important and Bapco
took measures to avoid damaging the
line and potentially interrupting service.
• Hidd dry dock road, adjacent
pipelines, cables, and services. This fourlane highway provides the only land
access to ASRY dry dock and is adjacent
to power, telephone, and water services.
Onshore activities at Hidd included installing a metering station and pipelines
to customers. These pipelines ran at
right angles to the offshore pipeline and
had to be crossed.

Excavation of the trench from the wharf valve station across QAQ Island used tracked excavators, working during daylight at low tide in the offshore areas.The excavators created their own causeways using
excavated fill (Fig. 4).

This photograph shows the path of the trenching works from WVS to QAQ Island (Fig. 5).
of the crossing required communication with and cooperation of the port
authority, coast guard, and Bahrain
defense force. All parties had to agree
to scheduling of pipe trench works and
pipe pulling. Penetration of the freshwater aquifer also had to be avoided.
This aquifer lay only a few feet below
the target depth of the pipelines at
places in the deepwater channel.
Facilities of three major utilities also
required crossing. These crossings were:

Island (Fig. 1). These 66 kv cables, located on the north side of QAQ, provide
power to ASRY dry dock, AISCO iron
ore pelletizing plant, and other residential-business users. Bapco placed severe
restrictions on the contractor relating to
scheduling of the work on the crossing, protecting the cables from damage,
and maintaining the minimum vertical
clearance.
• Existing 10-in. gas line on QAQ Island (Fig. 2). This gas pipeline supplies
high-pressure Khuff gas to the AISCO
iron ore pelletizing plant and had to

Onshore fabrication
Bapco established an onshore fabrication yard (Fig. 3) for welding pipe
joints into strings about 348 m long,
building a total of 51 strings. Fabrication included welding pipes together,
weld inspection, holiday testing of
coating, pressure testing, concrete
weight coating installation, heat shrink
sleeve application, and bracelet aluminum anodes installation.
Setup within the pipe yard allowed
completed strings to be rolled across
the pipe racks to the launch ramps,
where pipe strings were gathered in
order of laying. The two thicknesses of
pipe required they be arranged in the
correct order for pulling and launching.
Following fabrication, Bapco prepared
the pipes for launching into the sea via
a preinstalled access way under the dry
dock highway.

Offshore excavation
Offshore activities included excavation of the trench from the pipeline’s
wharf valve station to and across QAQ
Island with tracked excavators. The excavators either created their own causeway with excavated fill or were loaded
onto barges (Fig. 4). A barge-mounted
grab bucket and dredger completed
excavation and trenching across the
shipping channel.
Trenching works in some of the
shallow waters from the WVS to QAQ
Island could occur only at low tide and

cavators (Fig. 5-6). Some shallow-water
fish traps also needed to be removed in
coordination with owners and marine
organizations.
Extra care was taken where the new
lines crossed the 10-in. line supplying high-pressure gas to the iron ore
pelletizing plant at the southern shore
of QAQ Island (Fig. 7). Precautions
included installation of marker posts
or buoys along the 10-in. gas line and
8-in. jet fuel line. A pipeline locator, followed by hand excavation of trial holes,
determined the exact location of the jet
fuel line.
Preserving the integrity of the local
freshwater aquifer, which lay only a few
feet below the bottom of the trench
in the area of the shipping channel,
required close monitoring of excavation activities and liaison with the water Bapco excavated trenches between WVS and QAQ Island using this marine channel trenching barge (Fig.

resource directorate.

Pipe positioning
Launch of each of the 51 strings
took place from the pipe yard through
the pipe launch system under the dry
dock highway. Casings installed under
the highway used the open cut method.
Rollers installed on either side of the
casing helped launch the strings.
A 300-mt capacity linear gripper
winch bottom pulled strings in trenches near WVS. These winches worked
from a barge anchored in shallow water.
They ran along the trench through QAQ
Island and across the marine channel.
On QAQ Island rotating guides allowed
the pipes to negotiate the curve on the
island. Buoyancy aids attached to each
string reduced the submerged weight
while maintaining negative buoyancy
and stability.
The capacity of the winch proved to
be inadequate during the first bottom
pull. The pipeline contractor decommissioned the pipe pull barge and located a 200-mt capacity winch spread
on QAQ Island. Flotation devices again
provided some buoyancy. Pulling each
string from the yard entailed welding the next string to it, performing
NDT on the weld, applying heat-shrink
sleeves and concrete weight, and then

resuming the pull. This sequence
installed the pipeline on the bottom of
the trench from QAQ Island to the dry
dock highway crossing.
Shallow waters in the area between

WVS and QAQ Island required each
string be floated into position on the
surface. All activity related to the pulling
or floating of strings from the fabrication yard ran through the various
marine agencies to ensure shipping was
not unduly affected.

the trenches occurred only after verification the pipelines had been laid in the
proper location.
Application of a protective rock
layer followed backfill, addressing the
tendency of ships to drag anchor in the
marine channel area.

Hydrostatic testing

Offshore field tie-ins used welding on pontoons from which completed lengths were lowered (Fig. 8).

Following construction activities,
including installation of pig launching
and receiving facilities at each end, the
pipelines underwent various swabbing activities to clean them internally
and confirm roundness had remained
within specification. Specification for
the gauging plate was 95% ID.
The pipeline contractor enlisted the
assistance of the Bahrain civil defense
fire service to expedite swabbing and
pigging. The fire service provided newly
acquired fire trucks and pumps to fill
the line with water. This not only provided a reliable pumping system, but
also gave the fire brigade the opportunity to severely test newly acquired
equipment.

Repairs
Swabbing and gauge plate runs
revealed the easternmost pipeline had
a serious obstruction, either internal
or external. The pipeline contractor
recruited a specialist company to smart

Gas engine introduced to compressor operations
This firm’s 34SG gas engines now are
available for gas compressor operations.
With outputs of 4,050-9,000 kw
(5,430 to 12,070 bhp), these gas engines
are suited for gas pipelines and gas storage.
Three versions are available: the
9-cylinder in-line 9L34SG with 4,050 kw
(5,430 bhp) shaft power, the 16-cylinder
16V34SG engine with 7,200 kw (9,655
bhp), and the 20-cylinder 20V34SG with
9,000 kw (12,070 bhp) shaft power. The
nominal speed is 750 rpm. Compared
with gas turbines often used for driving
compressor sets in this power range, 34SG
engines offer lower fuel gas consumption
and greater turndown ratios, the company
says.
Engines have a full-load efficiency of
46.3% (heat rate 5,493 btu/hp-hr), a
30% speed turndown ratio (to 525 rpm),
and a 70% torque turndown ratio. Engine
efficiency and exhaust emissions remain
virtually unchanged on the whole load
range. The 34SG engine has low exhaust

emissions. NOX emissions remain below
the 500 mg/cu Nm dry at 5% O2 level
throughout the entire speed and torque
range. Engines have a fully electronic
control system for all the main engine
functions: gas feed, charge airflow, fuel
gas flow control, individual cylinders, and
ignition control.

Intensity rising
in the politics of
energy villainy
Intensity is rising in the politics of energy villainy.
This brand of politics, peculiar to the
US, treats energy not as a vital national
concern but as a morality play.
If something goes wrong with energy—
meaning gasoline prices rise—politicians
identify villains and heroically ﬂail away.
Villains teem in legislation about which
discussion has revived in Congress.

T h e
E d i t o r ’ s
P e r s p e c t i v e
by Bob Tippee, Editor

Oil companies! Oil speculators! Price
gougers! OPEC! Villains—all of them!
So elected heroes are now preparing to
charge into political battle to subdue the
scoundrels with taxes, regulations, even
criminal prohibitions.
They’re also brandishing anew the
threat of a windfall proﬁt tax, the imposition of which would give them something
to pound their chests about.
History, though, spoils the tale. It shows
that windfall proﬁt taxes don’t lower
gasoline prices. Windfall proﬁt taxes lower
oil supplies. And lower oil supplies raise
gasoline prices.
Even for elected heroes, this is not
difﬁcult to understand. So why would
elected heroes want to repeat an expensive
mistake?
If there’s a dark force elevating oil prices
it’s the cumulative effect of past decisions
hostile to the development of domestic oil
and gas supply, including the original windfall proﬁt tax. Other decisions suppressing
supply now or in the past include refusal to
approve leasing of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge Coastal Plain, moratoriums on
oil and gas leasing of the Outer Continental
Shelf, and regulatory impediments to reﬁnery and pipeline construction.
Sinister, too, is the dominant fantasy
that the economy can somehow show no
strain—and that consumers can somehow
beneﬁt—from the replacement of highpotential, low-cost energy forms with lowpotential, high-cost substitutes.
So if energy has to be construed in dramatic terms in order to attract the attention
it needs then, yes, the subject does have its
villains.
They’re lawmakers who take simplistic
political advantage of complex energy
problems, who propose to repeat historic
mistakes, and who refuse to act except in
token ways on energy consumers’ premier
interest: abundant and affordable supply.
These villains don’t need to be slain.
They just need to be removed from ofﬁce
before they do any more harm.

J o u r n a l

by Sam Fletcher, Senior Writer

Energy prices continue climbing
The June contract for US light, sweet crudes jumped to a record of $126.27/bbl
May 9 on the New York Mercantile Exchange before closing at a record $125.96/bbl,
gaining a total $9.64/bbl over ﬁve trading sessions that week.
North Sea Brent crude gained $10.84/bbl to $125.40/bbl that same week. Gasoline
matched crude’s gains on NYMEX, up $9.66/bbl to $3.20 gal. “But no one could come
close to the weekly gains of heating oil at $17.64/bbl, [closing at a record $3.64/gal on
May 9]” said Olivier Jakob at Petromatrix, Zug, Switzerland.
The price rally was fueled in part by evidence that Venezuelan President Hugo
Chavez has aided rebels in the attempted overthrow of the government of Colombia.
Investors fear Venezuela will cut off crude supplies to the US if the US government
imposes sanctions against that country.
Market speculation
Many analysts attribute the oil-price surge to a general weakness of the US dollar
against other key currencies and to the large amount of speculative funds invested
into the commodities market. As a result, a bill is pending in the US Senate that
would impose speculative-trading limits for West Texas Intermediate on the London
markets, like those on the New York market.
“Since 2002 and the beginning of the boom in commodity prices, it has become
increasingly fashionable to blame a large part of this rise on the speculative community,” said Adam Sieminski, chief energy economist for Deutsche Bank, “While
we agree that disconnects between price and underlying physical fundamentals can
occur due to investor ﬂows, we believe that such anomalies cannot persist for long
and that underlying fundamentals remain the ultimate drivers of commodity prices,
forward curves, and volatility.”
Moreover, he said, “The rally in nonexchange traded commodity prices, such as
molybdenum, cadmium, and ferrochrome, since the end of 2002 has been similar
if not greater in magnitude than the rally in exchange traded commodities, such as
crude oil and copper, where speculative inﬂows are possible.” Sieminski said, “We
believe this refutes the claim that speculators have been the primary drivers of rising
commodity prices during this cycle. Rather it may be an indication of the increasing
pricing power that resides with commodity producing companies and countries.”
Sieminski said, “The oil price has continued to rally in the face of a stronger US
dollar and conﬁrms to us that this relationship was always built on shaky foundations. We do not see any signs yet that non-OECD [Organization for Economic
Cooperation and Development] oil demand is suffering from the rise in oil prices. On
our various measures, oil prices would need to rise above $150/bbl to be considered
extreme.”
Goldman Sachs Group Inc. forecast crude costs could escalate to $150-200/bbl
within 2 years (OGJ Online, May 6, 2008). In 1985, a team of Goldman Sachs analysts
forecast a spike of crude prices to $50-105/bbl at some point within a few years because of continued unexpected strength in world oil demand and economic growth,
especially in the US and China. Olivier Jakob at Petromatrix, Zug, Switzerland, said,
“Crude oil is currently held up in a tug-of-war between the Goldman reality and the
physical reality. Even though the world economy has not yet proven that it was able
to cope with the ﬁrst super spike (on a dollar-adjusted basis we are only starting to
approach the $105/bbl of the ﬁrst Goldman super spike), it still makes a great story to
support pension funds piling more into commodities.”
Meanwhile, higher prices are having virtually no major impact on world oil demand because of government subsidies that reduce the true cost for fuels in many
countries. Nor will it produce new crude supplies because the only readily available
spare production capacity is controlled by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting
Countries.
Abdalla Salem El-Badri, OPEC secretary general, said, “There is clearly no
shortage of oil in the market. OECD commercial oil stocks remain above the 5-year
average, with days of forward cover at a comfortable level of more than 53 days.
US crude inventories, meanwhile, rose by almost 6 million bbl last week, which is
a further indication that oil supplies are plentiful. OPEC member countries continue
to produce at more than 32 million b/d. In addition, a number of new OPEC crude
oil projects have started to come on-stream and OPEC spare capacity continues to
increase, with the ﬁgure currently standing above 3 million b/d. At the same time,
crude oil movements indicate that some member countries are unable to ﬁnd buyers
for their additional supply.”
